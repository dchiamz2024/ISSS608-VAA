# **11 - Choropleth Mapping with R**

## **11.1 Overview**

Choropleth mapping involves the symbolisation of enumeration units, such as countries, provinces, states, counties or census units, using area patterns or graduated colors. For example, a social scientist may need to use a choropleth map to portray the spatial distribution of aged population of Singapore by Master Plan 2014 Subzone Boundary.

In this chapter, you will learn how to plot functional and truthful choropleth maps by using an R package called [**tmap**](https://r-tmap.github.io/tmap/) package.
