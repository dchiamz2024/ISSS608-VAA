# 1 - Getting Started

## Install and Launching R Packages

The code chunk below uses p_load() of pacman package to check if tidyverse packages are installed in the computer. If they are, then they will be launched into R.

*Note: Pacman is like a package manager, Tidyverse are packages for data science eg. plotting, wrangling, cleaning, visualization etc*

```{r}
pacman::p_load(tidyverse) 
```

## Importing the data

*Note: if you did not run the first code chunk tidyverse, this will indicate not found. read_csv is a code from tidyverse*

```{r}
exam_data <- read_csv("data/Exam_data.csv")
```

# Plotting a Simple Bar Chart

```{r}
#|evaluation = FALSE
ggplot(data = exam_data,
       aes(x = RACE)) +
  geom_bar()
```
