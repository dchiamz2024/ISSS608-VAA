# **1. Overview**

## **Setting the scene**

A local online media company that publishes daily content on digital platforms is planning to release an article on **demographic structures and distribution of Singapore in 2024**.

## **The task**

Assuming the role of the graphical editor of the media company, the task was to prepare **at most three data visualisation** for the exercise.

Hence in this exercise, I curated three key visualisations as part of dats exploration:

-   **Generational Distribution by Region:** A paired bar chart highlights both absolute and relative generational makeup across Singapore’s five planning regions, revealing the Central and East as home to proportionally older populations.
-   **Age Demographics by Planning Area:** A boxplot with overlaid generation bands showcases median age and interquartile ranges, emphasising regions with mature population profiles like Central and West Singapore.
-   **Top Planning Areas by Age Band:** A set of ranked bar charts and accompanying pie charts depict the top 15 planning areas by population size in three age segments—youth (0–24), adults (25–54), and seniors (55+). These are complemented with gender breakdowns to visualise demographic imbalances.

# **2. Getting started, Data Loading and Preparation**

This section documents the process of preparing the dataset for analysis and visualization. It covers the loading of R packages, initial inspection of the dataset, and the necessary wrangling and transformation steps applied.

### **2.1 Load required packages 📦**

Before importing the data, we load several R packages from the **tidyverse** ecosystem and supporting libraries for data wrangling and visualization. These packages streamline data processing and produce publication-ready plots using `ggplot2`. This setup ensure that we have both the flexibility and power to craft expressive, publication-quality demographic visualizations for the report.

📌 **Summary of Package Roles**

| Library | Description |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) | A collection of core packages designed for data science, used extensively for data preparation and wrangling |
| [**knitr**](https://yihui.org/knitr/) | Generates dynamic R markdown or Quarto reports |
| [**patchwork**](https://patchwork.data-imaginist.com/) | Combine multiple ggplots into a single layout |
| [**ggthemes**](https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/) | Provides extra themes (e.g. economist, wsj) |

  ggnewscale,    # Allows multiple color/fill scales in one ggplot
  ggrepel        # Allows
)
```

### **2.2** Loading the Data and Taking a Glimpse of the Dataset **📂**

The dataset, *Singapore Residents by Planning Area / Subzone, Single Year of Age and Sex, June 2024*, published by the [Department of Statistics, Singapore (DOS)](https://www.singstat.gov.sg/) was loaded using the `read_csv()` function from the `readr` package in the tidyverse collection.

```{r}

# Load the dataset
df <- read_csv("Dataset/respopagesex2024.csv")

```

The dataset contains **60,424 rows** and **6 columns**. Each row represents the count of residents for a specific combination of planning area, subzone, age, sex, and year.

```{r}

glimpse(df)
```

🧾 **Variable Descriptions**

| Column | Type | Description |
|------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| `PA` | Categorical | Planning Area (e.g., Ang Mo Kio, Bedok) |
| `SZ` | Categorical | Subzone within each Planning Area |
| `Age` | Categorical (to be converted) | Age in single years (e.g., 0–100+) |
| `Sex` | Categorical | Gender: Male / Female |
| `Pop` | Continuous (Integer) | Number of residents (rounded to nearest 10) |
| `Time` | Identifier / Constant | Time period (always 2024 in this dataset) |

### **2.3** **Wrangling, Cleaning & Transformation 🧹**

To ensure the data is ready for exploratory visualization and demographic analysis, a series of wrangling and transformation steps are applied. These steps are logically grouped and reusable across multiple visualization tasks.

#### ✅ Convert **`Age`** to Integer

The `Age` column is stored as a character string (e.g., `"100+"`), which can prevent proper sorting, numeric comparisons, and calculations. I converted it to an integer, coercing `"100+"` to `100`, and remove any missing or malformed entries.

This step ensures that age values are usable in:

-   Population pyramids
-   Median age calculations
-   Age band groupings

```{r}

df <- df %>%
  mutate(Age = as.integer(Age)) %>%  # Convert to numeric (100+ becomes NA)
  drop_na(Age)                       # Remove missing values caused by conversion


```

#### ✅ Create `AgeBand` for Grouped Analysis

Working with 101 separate age values (0–100) may clutter visualizations and dilute insight. Therefore, I bin the ages into meaningful age bands for easier demographic comparison and comparative visualization. These age bands are especially helpful for:

-   Grouped bar charts
-   Age structure comparisons across planning areas

```{r}

df <- df %>%
  mutate(AgeBand = cut(Age,
    breaks = c(0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55,
               60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, 100, Inf),
    labels = c("0-4", "5-9", "10-14", "15-19", "20-24", "25-29",
               "30-34", "35-39", "40-44", "45-49", "50-54",
               "55-59", "60-64", "65-69", "70-74", "75-79",
               "80-84", "85-89", "90-94", "95-99", "100+"),
    right = FALSE))

```

#### ✅ Aggregate for Exploratory Plots & Key Insights

The data was group by Planning Area, Sex, and Age Band to prepare for visual comparisons across demographic segments. Using the code below, we can compute the **aggregated population totals** across:

-   **Age × Sex**: for national pyramids
-   **Planning Area**: for ranking and spatial comparisons

```{r}

# For population pyramid (Age-Sex)
pyramid_data <- df %>%
  group_by(Age, Sex) %>%
  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop), .groups = "drop")

# For top 5 planning areas
top5_pa <- df %>%
  group_by(PA) %>%
  summarise(Pop = sum(Pop), .groups = "drop") %>%
  slice_max(order_by = Pop, n = 5)

```

#### ✅ Add Region Classification Based on Planning Area

To enhance geographical analysis, we classify each Planning Area (`PA`) into one of Singapore’s five official regions (1) Central, (2) East, (3) North, (4) North-East, and (5) West. This grouping follows Singapore’s **Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) Master Plan** and allows for cleaner regional comparisons, faceted plots, and high-level demographic summaries.

```{r}

df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    PA = str_trim(str_to_upper(PA)),
    Region = case_when(
      PA %in% c("BISHAN", "BUKIT MERAH", "BUKIT TIMAH", "CENTRAL AREA", "DOWNTOWN CORE",
                "GEYLANG", "KALLANG", "MARINA EAST", "MARINA SOUTH", "MUSEUM", "NEWTON",
                "NOVENA", "ORCHARD", "OUTRAM", "PAYA LEBAR", "QUEENSTOWN", "RIVER VALLEY",
                "ROCHOR", "SINGAPORE RIVER", "SOUTHERN ISLANDS", "STRAITS VIEW", "TANGLIN",
                "TOA PAYOH", "MARINE PARADE") ~ "Central",
      PA %in% c("BEDOK", "CHANGI", "CHANGI BAY", "PASIR RIS", "TAMPINES") ~ "East",
      PA %in% c("CENTRAL WATER CATCHMENT", "MANDAI", "SEMBABWANG", "SIMPANG",
                "SUNGEI KADUT", "WOODLANDS", "YISHUN", "SEMBAWANG") ~ "North",
      PA %in% c("ANG MO KIO", "HOUGANG", "NORTH-EASTERN ISLANDS", "PUNGGOL",
                "SELETAR", "SENGKANG", "SERANGOON") ~ "North-East",
      PA %in% c("BOON LAY", "BUKIT BATOK", "BUKIT PANJANG", "CHOA CHU KANG",
                "CLEMENTI", "JURONG EAST", "JURONG WEST", "LIM CHU KANG",
                "PIONEER", "TENGAH", "TUAS", "WESTERN ISLANDS",
                "WESTERN WATER CATCHMENT") ~ "West",
      TRUE ~ NA_character_
    )
  )

```

#### ✅ Compute the Weighted Median Age

As the simple median of the `Age` column would be misleading, as it treats each age as equally populated. Instead, we calculate a **weighted median** that reflects **actual population counts** per age to give a statistically more accurate median age for the **entire Singapore resident population**..

```{r}

df_median <- df %>%
  arrange(Age) %>%
  mutate(
    cum_pop = cumsum(Pop),
    total_pop = sum(Pop)
  ) %>%
  filter(cum_pop >= total_pop / 2) %>%
  slice(1)

median_age <- df_median$Age

```

#### ✅ Generation Band Mapping 

Create Generation bands based on categories.

```{r}

df <- df %>%
  mutate(
    GenerationBand = case_when(
      Age <= 24 ~ "Alpha & Gen Z (0–24)",
      Age <= 34 ~ "Young Adults (25–34)",
      Age <= 54 ~ "Working Adults (35–54)",
      Age <= 64 ~ "Silver Generation (55–64)",
      Age <= 74 ~ "Merdeka Generation (65–74)",
      TRUE ~ "Pioneer Generation (75+)"
    ),
    GenerationBand = factor(GenerationBand, levels = c(
      "Alpha & Gen Z (0–24)", "Young Adults (25–34)", "Working Adults (35–54)",
      "Silver Generation (55–64)", "Merdeka Generation (65–74)", "Pioneer Generation (75+)"
    ))
  )

```

#### ✅ Create Aggregated Summary Table

```{r}

df_summary <- df %>%
  group_by(Region, PA, AgeBand, Sex) %>%
  summarise(Total = sum(Pop), .groups = "drop")

```

# 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) 📊

### 🔍 **3.1 What is the age and gender structure in the Singapore resident population?**

**Goal**: Understand whether the population skews young or old, and whether the gender balance is even.

**Method**: Population pyramids using mirrored horizontal bar charts, grouped by sex and age band.

![](/Images/Insights.png){width="42"} [<strong>Insights gleamed from this plot in section 3.1</strong>]{style="font-size: 30px; vertical-align: middle;"}

This population pyramid reveals the demographic structure of Singapore’s resident population as of June 2024. The mirrored horizontal bars clearly show that the population is ageing — with a substantial share concentrated in the 40–64 age bands. The gender distribution is broadly balanced across most age groups, although a higher proportion of females is observed in older age bands, reflecting longer female life expectancy. Younger cohorts (under 25) form a smaller share of the population, suggesting lower birth rates and potential long-term shrinkage of the working-age base. This age imbalance, combined with rising median age, has strategic implications for healthcare planning, social security, and labour force renewal. The pyramid’s symmetry and visual labeling facilitate quick interpretation, while the grey-backed percentage markers offer contextual understanding without clutter. Overall, the chart underscores the demographic transition toward an ageing population — a trend aligned with those of other developed urban nations.

### 🔍 **3.2 How are age groups distributed across the five regions?**

**Goal**: To explore the demographic composition across Singapore’s five regions using meaningful generational groupings, this visualisation compares the proportion of residents by age cohort. It addresses how youth, workforce, and senior populations differ geographically.

**Method**: Using the 2024 DOS dataset, residents are grouped by region and classified into six age bands based on Singapore’s social-policy generations: *Alpha & Gen Z (0–24yo), Young Adults (25–34yo), Working Adults (35–54yo), Silver Generation (55–64yo), Merdeka Generation (65–74yo), and Pioneer Generation (\>75yo)*. Percentages are calculated within each region and plotted using a colour-safe, perceptually consistent palette to enhance visual clarity and accessibility.

This visualisation examines the generational distribution of Singapore’s resident population across the five main planning regions, using both absolute population counts and proportional shares. The left panel highlights the total number of residents in each generation, while the right panel normalises these figures to show the internal demographic mix within each region.

These visualisations compares Singapore’s resident population by generation across the five main planning regions, using both absolute ounts (left panel) and proportional shares (right panel). **Working adults (ages 35–54)** form the largest demographic in all regions, especially in the **East and North**. However, the **Central region** stands out for its **higher concentration of older residents**, particularly from the **Merdeka and Pioneer generations**, both in absolute numbers and as a proportion of its population.

Conversely, the **North-East and West** regions show a higher share of **younger residents under 35**, reflecting newer housing developments and growing family clusters. While younger generations are more evenly spread in these regions, older cohorts are disproportionately concentrated in the **Central, East, and West**.

Supporting this, the **boxplots and age summaries** reveal **higher median ages** and **tighter interquartile ranges** in these ageing regions—highlighting a more mature demographic profile that warrants targeted **urban planning, healthcare, and ageing-in-place strategies**.
:::

### 🔍 **3.3 Which Planning Areas have the most concentration of Young and Working Adults?**

**Goal**: To examine the demographic concentration and gender composition of different age cohorts (below 25, 25–54, and 55+) across Singapore’s planning areas. This analysis focuses on identifying the top 15 planning areas with the highest population for each age band and further breaks down their gender profiles.

**Method**: Resident population data from June 2024 was filtered into three distinct age groups: youth (0–24), young and working adults (25–54), and seniors (55+). For each segment, the 15 planning areas with the highest populations were identified. Bar charts show absolute counts and pie charts show male-to-female ratios. Standardised colour schemes are used for clarity and comparison across visualisations.

The analysis reveals key demographic concentrations across Singapore's planning areas. Among the 25–54 age group, Tampines, Woodlands, and Jurong West lead in population count, underscoring that large working population concentrated outside of the Core Central Regions.

In contrast, seniors (aged 55+) are more prevalent in mature estates like Bedok and Ang Mo Kio, reflecting Singapore’s ageing trends in older heartland areas.

Meanwhile, youth under 25 are highly concentrated in newer developments such as Punggol and Sengkang. This possibly implies there are a larger proportion of families with younger children in these areas.

Gender distributions across all top 15 regions remain relatively balanced, with a slight female predominance in most areas. This could indicate higher female longevity.

# 4. Conclusion 📊

This take-home exercise explored Singapore’s resident population data from June 2024 through a multi-dimensional demographic lens. By integrating age, gender, region, and planning area, the analysis produced targeted insights into population structure and spatial distribution patterns.

These visualisations serve not only to illustrate where population clusters form but also guide strategic planning for infrastructure, housing, healthcare, and youth development. As Singapore grapples with challenges such as an ageing population, urban density, and equitable access to services, such granular analysis becomes critical. Overall, these patterns offer valuable insights for urban planners and policymakers.

Moving forward, the dataset could be expanded with ethnicity, housing type, or socio-economic markers to deepen the insights. Future research may also explore temporal trends using past census data, or predictive modelling to anticipate demographic shifts in upcoming housing developments.
