    "text": "Parallel coordinates plot is a data visualisation specially designed for visualising and analysing multivariate, numerical data. It is ideal for comparing multiple variables together and seeing the relationships between them. For example, the variables contribute to Happiness Index. Parallel coordinates was invented by Alfred Inselberg in the 1970s as a way to visualize high-dimensional data. This data visualisation technique is more often found in academic and scientific communities than in business and consumer data visualizations. As pointed out by Stephen Few(2006), “This certainly isn’t a chart that you would present to the board of directors or place on your Web site for the general public. In fact, the strength of parallel coordinates isn’t in their ability to communicate some truth in the data to others, but rather in their ability to bring meaningful multivariate patterns and comparisons to light when used interactively for analysis.” For example, parallel coordinates plot can be used to characterise clusters detected during customer segmentation.\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on:\n\nplotting statistic parallel coordinates plots by using ggparcoord() of GGally package,\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parcoords package, and\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parallelPlot package.\n\n\n\n\nFor this exercise, the GGally, parcoords, parallelPlot and tidyverse packages will be used.\nThe code chunks below are used to install and load the packages in R.\n\npacman::p_load(GGally, parallelPlot, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the World Happinees 2018 (http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/) data will be used. The data set is download at https://s3.amazonaws.com/happiness-report/2018/WHR2018Chapter2OnlineData.xls. The original data set is in Microsoft Excel format. It has been extracted and saved in csv file called WHData-2018.csv.\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr package is used to import WHData-2018.csv into R and save it into a tibble data frame object called wh.\n\nwh &lt;- read_csv(\"DataEx09/WHData-2018.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to plot static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord() of GGally package. Before getting started, it is a good practice to read the function description in detail.\n\n\nCode chunk below shows a typical syntax used to plot a basic static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that only two argument namely data and columns is used. Data argument is used to map the data object (i.e. wh) and columns is used to select the columns for preparing the parallel coordinates plot.\n\n\n\nThe basic parallel coordinates failed to reveal any meaning understanding of the World Happiness measures. In this section, you will learn how to makeover the plot by using a collection of arguments provided by ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Parallel Coordinates Plot of World Happines Variables\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above.\n\ngroupColumn argument is used to group the observations (i.e. parallel lines) by using a single variable (i.e. Region) and colour the parallel coordinates lines by region name.\nscale argument is used to scale the variables in the parallel coordinate plot by using uniminmax method. The method univariately scale each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.\nalphaLines argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1.\nboxplot argument is used to turn on the boxplot by using logical TRUE. The default is FALSE.\ntitle argument is used to provide the parallel coordinates plot a title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince ggparcoord() is developed by extending ggplot2 package, we can combination use some of the ggplot2 function when plotting a parallel coordinates plot.\nIn the code chunk below, facet_wrap() of ggplot2 is used to plot 10 small multiple parallel coordinates plots. Each plot represent one geographical region such as East Asia.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the aesthetic defect of the current design is that some of the variable names overlap on x-axis.\n\n\n\nTo make the x-axis text label easy to read, let us rotate the labels by 30 degrees. We can rotate axis text labels using theme() function in ggplot2 as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nTo rotate x-axis text labels, we use axis.text.x as argument to theme() function. And we specify element_text(angle = 30) to rotate the x-axis text by an angle 30 degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotating x-axis text labels to 30 degrees makes the label overlap with the plot and we can avoid this by adjusting the text location using hjust argument to theme’s text element with element_text(). We use axis.text.x as we want to change the look of x-axis text.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust=1))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nparallelPlot is an R package specially designed to plot a parallel coordinates plot by using ‘htmlwidgets’ package and d3.js. In this section, you will learn how to use functions provided in parallelPlot package to build interactive parallel coordinates plot.\n\n\nThe code chunk below plot an interactive parallel coordinates plot by using parallelPlot().\n\nwh &lt;- wh %&gt;%\n  select(\"Happiness score\", c(7:12))\nparallelPlot(wh,\n             width = 320,\n             height = 250)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that some of the axis labels are too long. You will learn how to overcome this problem in the next step.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, rotateTitle argument is used to avoid overlapping axis labels.\n\nparallelPlot(wh,\n             rotateTitle = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the useful interactive feature of parallelPlot is we can click on a variable of interest, for example Happiness score, the monotonous blue colour (default) will change a blues with different intensity colour scheme will be used.\n\n\n\nWe can change the default blue colour scheme by using continousCS argument as shown in the code chunl below.\n\nparallelPlot(wh,\n             continuousCS = \"YlOrRd\",\n             rotateTitle = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, histoVisibility argument is used to plot histogram along the axis of each variables.\n\nhistoVisibility &lt;- rep(TRUE, ncol(wh))\nparallelPlot(wh,\n             rotateTitle = TRUE,\n             histoVisibility = histoVisibility)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggparcoord() of GGally package\nparcoords user guide\nparallelPlot"

As pointed out by Stephen Few(2006), “This certainly isn’t a chart that you would present to the board of directors or place on your Web site for the general public. In fact, the strength of parallel coordinates isn’t in their ability to communicate some truth in the data to others, but rather in their ability to bring meaningful multivariate patterns and comparisons to light when used interactively for analysis.” For example, parallel coordinates plot can be used to characterise clusters detected during customer segmentation.\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experience on:\n\nplotting statistic parallel coordinates plots by using ggparcoord() of GGally package,\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parcoords package, and\nplotting interactive parallel coordinates plots by using parallelPlot package."

    "text": "In this section, you will learn how to plot static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord() of GGally package. Before getting started, it is a good practice to read the function description in detail.\n\n\nCode chunk below shows a typical syntax used to plot a basic static parallel coordinates plot by using ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that only two argument namely data and columns is used. Data argument is used to map the data object (i.e. wh) and columns is used to select the columns for preparing the parallel coordinates plot.\n\n\n\nThe basic parallel coordinates failed to reveal any meaning understanding of the World Happiness measures. In this section, you will learn how to makeover the plot by using a collection of arguments provided by ggparcoord().\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Parallel Coordinates Plot of World Happines Variables\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above.\n\ngroupColumn argument is used to group the observations (i.e. parallel lines) by using a single variable (i.e. Region) and colour the parallel coordinates lines by region name.\nscale argument is used to scale the variables in the parallel coordinate plot by using uniminmax method. The method univariately scale each variable so the minimum of the variable is zero and the maximum is one.\nalphaLines argument is used to reduce the intensity of the line colour to 0.2. The permissible value range is between 0 to 1.\nboxplot argument is used to turn on the boxplot by using logical TRUE. The default is FALSE.\ntitle argument is used to provide the parallel coordinates plot a title.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince ggparcoord() is developed by extending ggplot2 package, we can combination use some of the ggplot2 function when plotting a parallel coordinates plot.\nIn the code chunk below, facet_wrap() of ggplot2 is used to plot 10 small multiple parallel coordinates plots. Each plot represent one geographical region such as East Asia.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the aesthetic defect of the current design is that some of the variable names overlap on x-axis.\n\n\n\nTo make the x-axis text label easy to read, let us rotate the labels by 30 degrees. We can rotate axis text labels using theme() function in ggplot2 as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nTo rotate x-axis text labels, we use axis.text.x as argument to theme() function. And we specify element_text(angle = 30) to rotate the x-axis text by an angle 30 degree.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRotating x-axis text labels to 30 degrees makes the label overlap with the plot and we can avoid this by adjusting the text location using hjust argument to theme’s text element with element_text(). We use axis.text.x as we want to change the look of x-axis text.\n\nggparcoord(data = wh, \n           columns = c(7:12), \n           groupColumn = 2,\n           scale = \"uniminmax\",\n           alphaLines = 0.2,\n           boxplot = TRUE, \n           title = \"Multiple Parallel Coordinates Plots of World Happines Variables by Region\") +\n  facet_wrap(~ Region) + \n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 30, hjust=1))"

    "text": "Correlation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coefficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coefficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\n\nTo reveal the relationship between high-dimensional variables pair-wisely.\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrices as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\n\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\n\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R. Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R.\n\n\n\nBefore you get started, you are required to open a new Quarto document. Keep the default html authoring format.\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\n\npacman::p_load(corrplot, ggstatsplot, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\n\n\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\n\nwine &lt;- read_csv(\"DataEx09/wine_quality.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are more than one way to build scatterplot matrix with R. In this section, you will learn how to create a scatterplot matrix by using the pairs function of R Graphics.\nBefore you continue to the next step, you should read the syntax description of pairsfunction.\n\n\nFigure below shows the scatter plot matrix of Wine Quality Data. It is a 11 by 11 matrix.\n\npairs(wine[,1:11])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe required input of pairs() can be a matrix or data frame. The code chunk used to create the scatterplot matrix is relatively simple. It uses the default pairs function. Columns 2 to 12 of wine dataframe is used to build the scatterplot matrix. The variables are: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npairs function of R Graphics provided many customisation arguments. For example, it is a common practice to show either the upper half or lower half of the correlation matrix instead of both. This is because a correlation matrix is symmetric.\nTo show the lower half of the correlation matrix, the upper.panel argument will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], upper.panel = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, you can display the upper half of the correlation matrix by using the code chun below.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], lower.panel = NULL)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo show the correlation coefficient of each pair of variables instead of a scatter plot, panel.cor function will be used. This will also show higher correlations in a larger font.\nDon’t worry about the details for now-just type this code into your R session or script. Let’s have more fun way to display the correlation matrix.\n\npanel.cor &lt;- function(x, y, digits=2, prefix=\"\", cex.cor, ...) {\nusr &lt;- par(\"usr\")\non.exit(par(usr))\npar(usr = c(0, 1, 0, 1))\nr &lt;- abs(cor(x, y, use=\"complete.obs\"))\ntxt &lt;- format(c(r, 0.123456789), digits=digits)[1]\ntxt &lt;- paste(prefix, txt, sep=\"\")\nif(missing(cex.cor)) cex.cor &lt;- 0.8/strwidth(txt)\ntext(0.5, 0.5, txt, cex = cex.cor * (1 + r) / 2)\n}\n\npairs(wine[,2:12], \n      upper.panel = panel.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the major limitation of the correlation matrix is that the scatter plots appear very cluttered when the number of observations is relatively large (i.e. more than 500 observations). To over come this problem, Corrgram data visualisation technique suggested by D. J. Murdoch and E. D. Chow (1996) and Friendly, M (2002) and will be used.\nThe are at least three R packages provide function to plot corrgram, they are:\n\ncorrgram\nellipse\ncorrplot\n\nOn top that, some R package like ggstatsplot package also provides functions for building corrgram.\nIn this section, you will learn how to visualising correlation matrix by using ggcorrmat() of ggstatsplot package.\n\n\nOn of the advantage of using ggcorrmat() over many other methods to visualise a correlation matrix is it’s ability to provide a comprehensive and yet professional statistical report as shown in the figure below.\n\nggstatsplot::ggcorrmat(\n  data = wine, \n  cor.vars = 1:11)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggstatsplot::ggcorrmat(\n  data = wine, \n  cor.vars = 1:11,\n  ggcorrplot.args = list(outline.color = \"black\", \n                         hc.order = TRUE,\n                         tl.cex = 10),\n  title    = \"Correlogram for wine dataset\",\n  subtitle = \"Four pairs are no significant at p &lt; 0.05\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\ncor.vars argument is used to compute the correlation matrix needed to build the corrgram.\nggcorrplot.args argument provide additional (mostly aesthetic) arguments that will be passed to ggcorrplot::ggcorrplot function. The list should avoid any of the following arguments since they are already internally being used: corr, method, p.mat, sig.level, ggtheme, colors, lab, pch, legend.title, digits.\n\nThe sample sub-code chunk can be used to control specific component of the plot such as the font size of the x-axis, y-axis, and the statistical report.\n\nggplot.component = list(\n    theme(text=element_text(size=5),\n      axis.text.x = element_text(size = 8),\n      axis.text.y = element_text(size = 8)))\n\n\n\n\n\nSince ggstasplot is an extension of ggplot2, it also supports faceting. However the feature is not available in ggcorrmat() but in the grouped_ggcorrmat() of ggstatsplot.\n\ngrouped_ggcorrmat(\n  data = wine,\n  cor.vars = 1:11,\n  grouping.var = type,\n  type = \"robust\",\n  p.adjust.method = \"holm\",\n  plotgrid.args = list(ncol = 2),\n  ggcorrplot.args = list(outline.color = \"black\", \n                         hc.order = TRUE,\n                         tl.cex = 10),\n  annotation.args = list(\n    tag_levels = \"a\",\n    title = \"Correlogram for wine dataset\",\n    subtitle = \"The measures are: alcohol, sulphates, fixed acidity, citric acid, chlorides, residual sugar, density, free sulfur dioxide and volatile acidity\",\n    caption = \"Dataset: UCI Machine Learning Repository\"\n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nto build a facet plot, the only argument needed is grouping.var.\nBehind group_ggcorrmat(), patchwork package is used to create the multiplot. plotgrid.args argument provides a list of additional arguments passed to patchwork::wrap_plots, except for guides argument which is already separately specified earlier.\nLikewise, annotation.args argument is calling plot annotation arguments of patchwork package.\n\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, we will focus on corrplot. However, you are encouraged to explore the other two packages too.\nBefore getting started, you are required to read An Introduction to corrplot Package in order to gain basic understanding of corrplot package.\n\n\nBefore we can plot a corrgram using corrplot(), we need to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\nIn the code chunk below, cor() of R Stats is used to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\n\nwine.cor &lt;- cor(wine[, 1:11])\n\nNext, corrplot() is used to plot the corrgram by using all the default setting as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the default visual object used to plot the corrgram is circle. The default layout of the corrgram is a symmetric matrix. The default colour scheme is diverging blue-red. Blue colours are used to represent pair variables with positive correlation coefficients and red colours are used to represent pair variables with negative correlation coefficients. The intensity of the colour or also know as saturation is used to represent the strength of the correlation coefficient. Darker colours indicate relatively stronger linear relationship between the paired variables. On the other hand, lighter colours indicates relatively weaker linear relationship.\n\n\n\nIn corrplot package, there are seven visual geometrics (parameter method) can be used to encode the attribute values. They are: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie. The default is circle. As shown in the previous section, the default visual geometric of corrplot matrix is circle. However, this default setting can be changed by using the method argument as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to change the method argument to other supported visual geometrics.\n\n\n\ncorrplor() supports three layout types, namely: “full”, “upper” or “lower”. The default is “full” which display full matrix. The default setting can be changed by using the type argument of corrplot().\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default layout of the corrgram can be further customised. For example, arguments diag and tl.col are used to turn off the diagonal cells and to change the axis text label colour to black colour respectively as shown in the code chunk and figure below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to experiment with other layout design argument such as tl.pos, tl.cex, tl.offset, cl.pos, cl.cex and cl.offset, just to mention a few of them.\n\n\n\nWith corrplot package, it is possible to design corrgram with mixed visual matrix of one half and numerical matrix on the other half. In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.\nFigure below shows a mixed layout corrgram plotted using wine quality data.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk used to plot the corrgram are shown below.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that argument lower and upper are used to define the visualisation method used. In this case ellipse is used to map the lower half of the corrgram and numerical matrix (i.e. number) is used to map the upper half of the corrgram. The argument tl.pos, on the other, is used to specify the placement of the axis label. Lastly, the diag argument is used to specify the glyph on the principal diagonal of the corrgram.\n\n\n\nIn statistical analysis, we are also interested to know which pair of variables their correlation coefficients are statistically significant.\nFigure below shows a corrgram combined with the significant test. The corrgram reveals that not all correlation pairs are statistically significant. For example the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free surfur dioxide is statistically significant at significant level of 0.1 but not the pair between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith corrplot package, we can use the cor.mtest() to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\nWe can then use the p.mat argument of corrplot function as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.\n\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\n“AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. More algorithms can be found in seriation package.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using hclust, corrplot() can draw rectangles around the corrgram based on the results of hierarchical clustering.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)"

It uses the default pairs function. Columns 2 to 12 of wine dataframe is used to build the scatterplot matrix. The variables are: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates and alcohol.\n\npairs(wine[,2:12])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npairs function of R Graphics provided many customisation arguments. For example, it is a common practice to show either the upper half or lower half of the correlation matrix instead of both.

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, we will focus on corrplot. However, you are encouraged to explore the other two packages too.\nBefore getting started, you are required to read An Introduction to corrplot Package in order to gain basic understanding of corrplot package.\n\n\nBefore we can plot a corrgram using corrplot(), we need to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\nIn the code chunk below, cor() of R Stats is used to compute the correlation matrix of wine data frame.\n\nwine.cor &lt;- cor(wine[, 1:11])\n\nNext, corrplot() is used to plot the corrgram by using all the default setting as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the default visual object used to plot the corrgram is circle. The default layout of the corrgram is a symmetric matrix. The default colour scheme is diverging blue-red. Blue colours are used to represent pair variables with positive correlation coefficients and red colours are used to represent pair variables with negative correlation coefficients. The intensity of the colour or also know as saturation is used to represent the strength of the correlation coefficient. Darker colours indicate relatively stronger linear relationship between the paired variables. On the other hand, lighter colours indicates relatively weaker linear relationship.\n\n\n\nIn corrplot package, there are seven visual geometrics (parameter method) can be used to encode the attribute values. They are: circle, square, ellipse, number, shade, color and pie. The default is circle. As shown in the previous section, the default visual geometric of corrplot matrix is circle. However, this default setting can be changed by using the method argument as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeel free to change the method argument to other supported visual geometrics.\n\n\n\ncorrplor() supports three layout types, namely: “full”, “upper” or “lower”. The default is “full” which display full matrix. The default setting can be changed by using the type argument of corrplot().\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default layout of the corrgram can be further customised. For example, arguments diag and tl.col are used to turn off the diagonal cells and to change the axis text label colour to black colour respectively as shown in the code chunk and figure below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         type=\"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease feel free to experiment with other layout design argument such as tl.pos, tl.cex, tl.offset, cl.pos, cl.cex and cl.offset, just to mention a few of them.\n\n\n\nWith corrplot package, it is possible to design corrgram with mixed visual matrix of one half and numerical matrix on the other half. In order to create a coorgram with mixed layout, the corrplot.mixed(), a wrapped function for mixed visualisation style will be used.\nFigure below shows a mixed layout corrgram plotted using wine quality data.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk used to plot the corrgram are shown below.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that argument lower and upper are used to define the visualisation method used. In this case ellipse is used to map the lower half of the corrgram and numerical matrix (i.e. number) is used to map the upper half of the corrgram. The argument tl.pos, on the other, is used to specify the placement of the axis label. Lastly, the diag argument is used to specify the glyph on the principal diagonal of the corrgram.\n\n\n\nIn statistical analysis, we are also interested to know which pair of variables their correlation coefficients are statistically significant.\nFigure below shows a corrgram combined with the significant test. The corrgram reveals that not all correlation pairs are statistically significant. For example the correlation between total sulfur dioxide and free surfur dioxide is statistically significant at significant level of 0.1 but not the pair between total sulfur dioxide and citric acid.\n\n\n\n\n\nWith corrplot package, we can use the cor.mtest() to compute the p-values and confidence interval for each pair of variables.\n\nwine.sig = cor.mtest(wine.cor, conf.level= .95)\n\nWe can then use the p.mat argument of corrplot function as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor,\n         method = \"number\",\n         type = \"lower\",\n         diag = FALSE,\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         tl.srt = 45,\n         p.mat = wine.sig$p,\n         sig.level = .05)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix reorder is very important for mining the hiden structure and pattern in a corrgram. By default, the order of attributes of a corrgram is sorted according to the correlation matrix (i.e. “original”). The default setting can be over-write by using the order argument of corrplot(). Currently, corrplot package support four sorting methods, they are:\n\n“AOE” is for the angular order of the eigenvectors. See Michael Friendly (2002) for details.\n“FPC” for the first principal component order.\n“hclust” for hierarchical clustering order, and “hclust.method” for the agglomeration method to be used.\n\n“hclust.method” should be one of “ward”, “single”, “complete”, “average”, “mcquitty”, “median” or “centroid”.\n\n“alphabet” for alphabetical order.\n\n“AOE”, “FPC”, “hclust”, “alphabet”. More algorithms can be found in seriation package.\n\ncorrplot.mixed(wine.cor, \n               lower = \"ellipse\", \n               upper = \"number\",\n               tl.pos = \"lt\",\n               diag = \"l\",\n               order=\"AOE\",\n               tl.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf using hclust, corrplot() can draw rectangles around the corrgram based on the results of hierarchical clustering.\n\ncorrplot(wine.cor, \n         method = \"ellipse\", \n         tl.pos = \"lt\",\n         tl.col = \"black\",\n         order=\"hclust\",\n         hclust.method = \"ward.D\",\n         addrect = 3)"

That means that if we do not account for how many water points are somewhere, we end up mapping total water point size rather than our topic of interest.\n\n\nWe will tabulate the proportion of functional water points and the proportion of non-functional water points in each LGA. In the following code chunk, mutate() from dplyr package is used to derive two fields, namely pct_functional and pct_nonfunctional.\n\nNGA_wp &lt;- NGA_wp %&gt;%\n  mutate(pct_functional = wp_functional/total_wp) %&gt;%\n  mutate(pct_nonfunctional = wp_nonfunctional/total_wp)\n\n\n\n\n\ntm_shape(NGA_wp) +\n  tm_polygons(\"pct_functional\",\n              fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n                style = \"equal\",\n                n = 10,\n                values = \"brewer.blues\"),\n              fill.legend = tm_legend(\n                position = c(\"right\", \"bottom\"))) + \n  tm_borders(lwd = 0.1,\n             fill_alpha = 1) +\n  tm_title(\"Rate map of functional water point by LGAs\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExtreme value maps are variations of common choropleth maps where the classification is designed to highlight extreme values at the lower and upper end of the scale, with the goal of identifying outliers. These maps were developed in the spirit of spatializing EDA, i.e., adding spatial features to commonly used approaches in non-spatial EDA (Anselin 1994).\n\n\nThe percentile map is a special type of quantile map with six specific categories: 0-1%,1-10%, 10-50%,50-90%,90-99%, and 99-100%. The corresponding breakpoints can be derived by means of the base R quantile command, passing an explicit vector of cumulative probabilities as c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1). Note that the begin and endpoint need to be included.\n\n\nStep 1: Exclude records with NA by using the code chunk below.\n\nNGA_wp &lt;- NGA_wp %&gt;%\n  drop_na()\n\nStep 2: Creating customised classification and extracting values\n\npercent &lt;- c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)\nvar &lt;- NGA_wp[\"pct_functional\"] %&gt;%\n  st_set_geometry(NULL)\nquantile(var[,1], percent)\n\n       0%        1%       10%       50%       90%       99%      100% \n0.0000000 0.0000000 0.2169811 0.4791667 0.8611111 1.0000000 1.0000000 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen variables are extracted from an sf data.frame, the geometry is extracted as well. For mapping and spatial manipulation, this is the expected behavior, but many base R functions cannot deal with the geometry. Specifically, the quantile() gives an error. As a result st_set_geomtry(NULL) is used to drop geomtry field.\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting a function has three big advantages over using copy-and-paste:\n\nYou can give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand.\nAs requirements change, you only need to update code in one place, instead of many.\nYou eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (i.e. updating a variable name in one place, but not in another).\n\nSource: Chapter 19: Functions of R for Data Science.\n\n\n\nFirstly, we will write an R function as shown below to extract a variable (i.e. wp_nonfunctional) as a vector out of an sf data.frame.\n\narguments:\n\nvname: variable name (as character, in quotes)\ndf: name of sf data frame\n\nreturns:\n\nv: vector with values (without a column name)\n\n\n\nget.var &lt;- function(vname,df) {\n  v &lt;- df[vname] %&gt;% \n    st_set_geometry(NULL)\n  v &lt;- unname(v[,1])\n  return(v)\n}\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will write a percentile mapping function by using the code chunk below.\n\npercentmap &lt;- function(vnam, df, legtitle=NA, mtitle=\"Percentile Map\"){\n  percent &lt;- c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)\n  var &lt;- get.var(vnam, df)\n  bperc &lt;- quantile(var, percent)\n  tm_shape(df) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_shape(df) +\n     tm_polygons(vnam,\n             title=legtitle,\n             breaks=bperc,\n             palette=\"Blues\",\n          labels=c(\"&lt; 1%\", \"1% - 10%\", \"10% - 50%\", \"50% - 90%\", \"90% - 99%\", \"&gt; 99%\"))  +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_layout(main.title = mtitle, \n            title.position = c(\"right\",\"bottom\"))\n}\n\n\n\n\nTo run the function, type the code chunk as shown below.\n\npercentmap(\"total_wp\", NGA_wp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this is just a bare bones implementation. Additional arguments such as the title, legend positioning just to name a few of them, could be passed to customise various features of the map.\n\n\n\n\nIn essence, a box map is an augmented quartile map, with an additional lower and upper category. When there are lower outliers, then the starting point for the breaks is the minimum value, and the second break is the lower fence.

    "text": "Extreme value maps are variations of common choropleth maps where the classification is designed to highlight extreme values at the lower and upper end of the scale, with the goal of identifying outliers. These maps were developed in the spirit of spatializing EDA, i.e., adding spatial features to commonly used approaches in non-spatial EDA (Anselin 1994).\n\n\nThe percentile map is a special type of quantile map with six specific categories: 0-1%,1-10%, 10-50%,50-90%,90-99%, and 99-100%. The corresponding breakpoints can be derived by means of the base R quantile command, passing an explicit vector of cumulative probabilities as c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1). Note that the begin and endpoint need to be included.\n\n\nStep 1: Exclude records with NA by using the code chunk below.\n\nNGA_wp &lt;- NGA_wp %&gt;%\n  drop_na()\n\nStep 2: Creating customised classification and extracting values\n\npercent &lt;- c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)\nvar &lt;- NGA_wp[\"pct_functional\"] %&gt;%\n  st_set_geometry(NULL)\nquantile(var[,1], percent)\n\n       0%        1%       10%       50%       90%       99%      100% \n0.0000000 0.0000000 0.2169811 0.4791667 0.8611111 1.0000000 1.0000000 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nWhen variables are extracted from an sf data.frame, the geometry is extracted as well. For mapping and spatial manipulation, this is the expected behavior, but many base R functions cannot deal with the geometry. Specifically, the quantile() gives an error. As a result st_set_geomtry(NULL) is used to drop geomtry field.\n\n\n\n\n\nWriting a function has three big advantages over using copy-and-paste:\n\nYou can give a function an evocative name that makes your code easier to understand.\nAs requirements change, you only need to update code in one place, instead of many.\nYou eliminate the chance of making incidental mistakes when you copy and paste (i.e. updating a variable name in one place, but not in another).\n\nSource: Chapter 19: Functions of R for Data Science.\n\n\n\nFirstly, we will write an R function as shown below to extract a variable (i.e. wp_nonfunctional) as a vector out of an sf data.frame.\n\narguments:\n\nvname: variable name (as character, in quotes)\ndf: name of sf data frame\n\nreturns:\n\nv: vector with values (without a column name)\n\n\n\nget.var &lt;- function(vname,df) {\n  v &lt;- df[vname] %&gt;% \n    st_set_geometry(NULL)\n  v &lt;- unname(v[,1])\n  return(v)\n}\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will write a percentile mapping function by using the code chunk below.\n\npercentmap &lt;- function(vnam, df, legtitle=NA, mtitle=\"Percentile Map\"){\n  percent &lt;- c(0,.01,.1,.5,.9,.99,1)\n  var &lt;- get.var(vnam, df)\n  bperc &lt;- quantile(var, percent)\n  tm_shape(df) +\n  tm_polygons() +\n  tm_shape(df) +\n     tm_polygons(vnam,\n             title=legtitle,\n             breaks=bperc,\n             palette=\"Blues\",\n          labels=c(\"&lt; 1%\", \"1% - 10%\", \"10% - 50%\", \"50% - 90%\", \"90% - 99%\", \"&gt; 99%\"))  +\n  tm_borders() +\n  tm_layout(main.title = mtitle, \n            title.position = c(\"right\",\"bottom\"))\n}\n\n\n\n\nTo run the function, type the code chunk as shown below.\n\npercentmap(\"total_wp\", NGA_wp)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote that this is just a bare bones implementation. Additional arguments such as the title, legend positioning just to name a few of them, could be passed to customise various features of the map.\n\n\n\n\nIn essence, a box map is an augmented quartile map, with an additional lower and upper category. When there are lower outliers, then the starting point for the breaks is the minimum value, and the second break is the lower fence. In contrast, when there are no lower outliers, then the starting point for the breaks will be the lower fence, and the second break is the minimum value (there will be no observations that fall in the interval between the lower fence and the minimum value).\n\nggplot(data = NGA_wp,\n       aes(x = \"\",\n           y = wp_nonfunctional)) +\n  geom_boxplot()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisplaying summary statistics on a choropleth map by using the basic principles of boxplot.\nTo create a box map, a custom breaks specification will be used.

This is because the values of PA and SZ fields are made up of upper- and lowercase. On the other, hand the SUBZONE_N and PLN_AREA_N are in uppercase.\n\npopdata2020 &lt;- popdata2020 %&gt;%\n  mutate(across(c(PA, SZ), toupper)) %&gt;%\n  filter(`ECONOMY ACTIVE` &gt; 0)\n\nNext, left_join() of dplyr is used to join the geographical data and attribute table using planning subzone name e.g. SUBZONE_N and SZ as the common identifier.\n\nmpsz_pop2020 &lt;- left_join(mpsz, popdata2020,\n                          by = c(\"SUBZONE_N\" = \"SZ\"))\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nleft_join() of dplyr package is used with mpsz simple feature data frame as the left data table is to ensure that the output will be a simple features data frame.\n\n\nwrite_rds(mpsz_pop2020, \"DataEx08/rds/mpszpop2020.rds\")"

    "text": "11.4 Choropleth Mapping Geospatial Data Using tmap\nTwo approaches can be used to prepare thematic map using tmap, they are:\n\nPlotting a thematic map quickly by using qtm().\nPlotting highly customisable thematic map by using tmap elements.\n\n\n11.4.1 Plotting a choropleth map quickly by using qtm()\nThe easiest and quickest to draw a choropleth map using tmap is using qtm(). It is concise and provides a good default visualisation in many cases.\nThe code chunk below will draw a cartographic standard choropleth map as shown below.\n\ntmap_mode(\"plot\")\nqtm(mpsz_pop2020, \n    fill = \"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\ntmap_mode() with “plot” option is used to produce a static map. For interactive mode, “view” option should be used.\nfill argument is used to map the attribute (i.e. DEPENDENCY)\n\n\n\n11.4.2 Creating a choropleth map by using tmap’s elements\nDespite its usefulness of drawing a choropleth map quickly and easily, the disadvantge of qtm() is that it makes aesthetics of individual layers harder to control. To draw a high quality cartographic choropleth map as shown in the figure below, tmap’s drawing elements should be used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"DEPENDENCY\", \n              fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n                style = \"quantile\",\n                n = 5,\n                values = \"brewer.blues\"),\n              fill.legend = tm_legend(\n                title = \"Dependency ratio\")) +\n  tm_title(\"Distribution of Dependency Ratio by planning subzone\") +\n  tm_layout(frame = TRUE) +\n  tm_borders(fill_alpha = 0.5) +\n  tm_compass(type=\"8star\", size = 2) +\n  tm_grid(alpha =0.2) +\n  tm_credits(\"Source: Planning Sub-zone boundary from Urban Redevelopment Authorithy (URA)\\n and Population data from Department of Statistics DOS\", \n             position = c(\"left\", \"bottom\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the following sub-section, we will share with you tmap functions that used to plot these elements.\n\n11.4.2.1 Drawing a base map\nThe basic building block of tmap is tm_shape() followed by one or more layer elemments such as tm_fill() and tm_polygons().\nIn the code chunk below, tm_shape() is used to define the input data (i.e mpsz_pop2020) and tm_polygons() is used to draw the planning subzone polygons.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020) +\n  tm_polygons()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n11.4.2.2 Drawing a choropleth map using tm_polygons()\nTo draw a choropleth map showing the geographical distribution of a selected variable by planning subzone, we just need to assign the target variable such as Dependency to tm_polygons().\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from tm_polygons():\n\nThe default interval binning used to draw the choropleth map is called “pretty”. A detailed discussion of the data classification methods supported by tmap will be provided in sub-section 4.3.\nThe default colour scheme used is YlOrRd of ColorBrewer. You will learn more about the color scheme in sub-section 4.4.\nBy default, Missing value will be shaded in grey.\n\n\n\n11.4.2.3 Drawing a choropleth map using tm_fill() and *tm_border()**\nActually, tm_polygons() is a wraper of tm_fill() and tm_border(). tm_fill() shades the polygons by using the default colour scheme and tm_borders() adds the borders of the shapefile onto the choropleth map.\nThe code chunk below draws a choropleth map by using tm_fill() alone.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_fill(\"DEPENDENCY\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the planning subzones are shared according to the respective dependecy values\nTo add the boundary of the planning subzones, tm_borders will be used as shown in the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(fill = \"DEPENDENCY\") +\n  tm_borders(lwd = 0.01,  \n             fill_alpha = 0.1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that light-gray border lines have been added on the choropleth map.\nThe alpha argument is used to define transparency number between 0 (totally transparent) and 1 (not transparent). By default, the alpha value of the col is used (normally 1).\nBeside alpha argument, there are three other arguments for tm_borders(), they are:\n\ncol = border colour,\nlwd = border line width. The default is 1, and\nlty = border line type. The default is “solid”.\n\n\n\n\n11.4.3 Data classification methods of tmap\nMost choropleth maps employ some methods of data classification. The point of classification is to take a large number of observations and group them into data ranges or classes.\ntmap provides a total ten data classification methods, namely: fixed, sd, equal, pretty (default), quantile, kmeans, hclust, bclust, fisher, and jenks.\nTo define a data classification method, the style argument of tm_fill() or tm_polygons() will be used.\n\n11.4.3.1 Plotting choropleth maps with built-in classification methods\nThe code chunk below shows a quantile data classification that used 5 classes.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n      fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n        style = \"jenks\",\n        n = 5)) +\n  tm_borders(fill_alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, equal data classification method is used.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n      fill.scale = tm_scale_intervals(\n        style = \"equal\",\n        n = 5)) +\n  tm_borders(fill_alpha = 0.5)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the distribution of quantile data classification method are more evenly distributed then equal data classification method.\n\nWarning: Maps Lie!\n\n\nDIY: Using what you had learned, prepare choropleth maps by using different classification methods supported by tmap and compare their differences.\n\n\nDIY: Preparing choropleth maps by using similar classification method but with different numbers of classes (i.e. 2, 6, 10, 20). Compare the output maps, what observation can you draw?\n\n\n\n11.4.3.2 Plotting choropleth map with custome break\nFor all the built-in styles, the category breaks are computed internally. In order to override these defaults, the breakpoints can be set explicitly by means of the breaks argument to the tm_fill(). It is important to note that, in tmap the breaks include a minimum and maximum. As a result, in order to end up with n categories, n+1 elements must be specified in the breaks option (the values must be in increasing order).\nBefore we get started, it is always a good practice to get some descriptive statistics on the variable before setting the break points. Code chunk below will be used to compute and display the descriptive statistics of DEPENDENCY field.\n\nsummary(mpsz_pop2020$DEPENDENCY)\n\n   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.    NA's \n 0.1111  0.7147  0.7867  0.8585  0.8763 19.0000      92 \n\n\nWith reference to the results above, we set break point at 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, and 0.90. In addition, we also need to include a minimum and maximum, which we set at 0 and 100. Our breaks vector is thus c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)\nNow, we will plot the choropleth map by using the code chunk below.\n\ntm_shape(mpsz_pop2020)+\n  tm_polygons(\"DEPENDENCY\",\n          breaks = c(0, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80, 0.90, 1.00)) +\n  tm_borders(fill_alpha = 0.5)"

It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\nBefore getting started, you are advised to read these two articles:\n\nIntroducing tidygraph\ntidygraph 1.1 - A tidy hope\n\n\n\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\n\na node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\ndata.frame, list, matrix from base,\nigraph from igraph,\nnetwork from network,\ndendrogram and hclust from stats,\nNode from data.tree,\nphylo and evonet from ape, and\ngraphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactivate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to tbl_graph object are applied to the active tibble.\n\nIn the above the .N() function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data. Similarly .E() will give you the edge data and .G() will give you the tbl_graph object itself.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use tbl_graph() of tinygraph package to build an tidygraph’s network graph data.frame.\nBefore typing the codes, you are recommended to review to reference guide of tbl_graph()\n\nGAStech_graph &lt;- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,\n                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, \n                           directed = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nGAStech_graph\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4 (active)\n      id label               Department     Title                               \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                               \n 1     1 Mat.Bramar          Administration Assistant to CEO                    \n 2     2 Anda.Ribera         Administration Assistant to CFO                    \n 3     3 Rachel.Pantanal     Administration Assistant to CIO                    \n 4     4 Linda.Lagos         Administration Assistant to COO                    \n 5     5 Ruscella.Mies.Haber Administration Assistant to Engineering Group Mana…\n 6     6 Carla.Forluniau     Administration Assistant to IT Group Manager       \n 7     7 Cornelia.Lais       Administration Assistant to Security Group Manager \n 8    44 Kanon.Herrero       Security       Badging Office                      \n 9    45 Varja.Lagos         Security       Badging Office                      \n10    46 Stenig.Fusil        Security       Building Control                    \n# ℹ 44 more rows\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4\n   from    to Weekday Weight\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     2 Sunday       5\n2     1     2 Monday       2\n3     1     2 Tuesday      3\n# ℹ 1,369 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output above reveals that GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 4541 edges.\nThe command also prints the first six rows of “Node Data” and the first three of “Edge Data”.\nIt states that the Node Data is active. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.\n\n\n\n\nThe nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the activate() function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest “weight” first, we could use activate() and then arrange().\nFor example,\n\nGAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  activate(edges) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Weight))\n\nVisit the reference guide of activate() to find out more about the function.\n\n\n\n\nggraph is an extension of ggplot2, making it easier to carry over basic ggplot skills to the design of network graphs.\nAs in all network graph, there are three main aspects to a ggraph’s network graph, they are:\n\nnodes,\nedges and\nlayouts.\n\nFor a comprehensive discussion of each of this aspect of graph, please refer to their respective vignettes provided.\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses ggraph(), geom-edge_link() and geom_node_point() to plot a network graph by using GAStech_graph. Before your get started, it is advisable to read their respective reference guide at least once.\n\nggraph(GAStech_graph) +\n  geom_edge_link() +\n  geom_node_point()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\nThe basic plotting function is ggraph(), which takes the data to be used for the graph and the type of layout desired. Both of the arguments for ggraph() are built around igraph. Therefore, ggraph() can use either an igraph object or a tbl_graph object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use theme_graph() to remove the x and y axes. Before your get started, it is advisable to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\nggraph introduces a special ggplot theme that provides better defaults for network graphs than the normal ggplot defaults. theme_graph(), besides removing axes, grids, and border, changes the font to Arial Narrow (this can be overridden).\nThe ggraph theme can be set for a series of plots with the set_graph_style() command run before the graphs are plotted or by using theme_graph() in the individual plots.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, theme_graph() makes it easy to change the coloring of the plot.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(colour = 'grey50')) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = 'grey40'))\n\ng + theme_graph(background = 'grey10',\n                text_colour = 'white')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggraph support many layout for standard used, they are: star, circle, nicely (default), dh, gem, graphopt, grid, mds, spahere, randomly, fr, kk, drl and lgl. Figures below and on the right show layouts supported by ggraph().\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunks below will be used to plot the network graph using Fruchterman and Reingold layout.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"fr\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\nlayout argument is used to define the layout to be used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will colour each node by referring to their respective departments.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department, \n                      size = 3))\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\ngeom_node_point is equivalent in functionality to geo_point of ggplot2. It allows for simple plotting of nodes in different shapes, colours and sizes. In the codes chnuks above colour and size are used.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the thickness of the edges will be mapped with the Weight variable.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 3)\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\n\ngeom_edge_link draws edges in the simplest way - as straight lines between the start and end nodes. But, it can do more that that. In the example above, argument width is used to map the width of the line in proportional to the Weight attribute and argument alpha is used to introduce opacity on the line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnother very useful feature of ggraph is faceting. In visualising network data, this technique can be used to reduce edge over-plotting in a very meaning way by spreading nodes and edges out based on their attributes. In this section, you will learn how to use faceting technique to visualise network data.\nThere are three functions in ggraph to implement faceting, they are:\n\nfacet_nodes() whereby edges are only draw in a panel if both terminal nodes are present here,\nfacet_edges() whereby nodes are always drawn in al panels even if the node data contains an attribute named the same as the one used for the edge facetting, and\nfacet_graph() faceting on two variables simultaneously.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, facet_edges() is used. Before getting started, it is advisable for you to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\nset_graph_style()\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2)\n\ng + facet_edges(~Weekday)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses theme() to change the position of the legend.\n\nset_graph_style()\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n  \ng + facet_edges(~Weekday)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below adds frame to each graph.\n\nset_graph_style() \n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 2)\n  \ng + facet_edges(~Weekday) +\n  th_foreground(foreground = \"grey80\",  \n                border = TRUE) +\n  theme(legend.position = 'bottom')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the code chunkc below, facet_nodes() is used.

There are four well-known centrality measures, namely: degree, betweenness, closeness and eigenvector. It is beyond the scope of this hands-on exercise to cover the principles and mathematics of these measure here.

from the “label” column in the node list.\n\nThe resulting graph is fun to play around with.\n\nYou can move the nodes and the graph will use an algorithm to keep the nodes properly spaced.\nYou can

    "text": "In this section, you will learn how to create a graph data model by using tidygraph package. It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\nBefore getting started, you are advised to read these two articles:\n\nIntroducing tidygraph\ntidygraph 1.1 - A tidy hope\n\n\n\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\n\na node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\ndata.frame, list, matrix from base,\nigraph from igraph,\nnetwork from network,\ndendrogram and hclust from stats,\nNode from data.tree,\nphylo and evonet from ape, and\ngraphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nactivate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to tbl_graph object are applied to the active tibble.\n\nIn the above the .N() function is used to gain access to the node data while manipulating the edge data. Similarly .E() will give you the edge data and .G() will give you the tbl_graph object itself.\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use tbl_graph() of tinygraph package to build an tidygraph’s network graph data.frame.\nBefore typing the codes, you are recommended to review to reference guide of tbl_graph()\n\nGAStech_graph &lt;- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,\n                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, \n                           directed = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nGAStech_graph\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4 (active)\n      id label               Department     Title                               \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                               \n 1     1 Mat.Bramar          Administration Assistant to CEO                    \n 2     2 Anda.Ribera         Administration Assistant to CFO                    \n 3     3 Rachel.Pantanal     Administration Assistant to CIO                    \n 4     4 Linda.Lagos         Administration Assistant to COO                    \n 5     5 Ruscella.Mies.Haber Administration Assistant to Engineering Group Mana…\n 6     6 Carla.Forluniau     Administration Assistant to IT Group Manager       \n 7     7 Cornelia.Lais       Administration Assistant to Security Group Manager \n 8    44 Kanon.Herrero       Security       Badging Office                      \n 9    45 Varja.Lagos         Security       Badging Office                      \n10    46 Stenig.Fusil        Security       Building Control                    \n# ℹ 44 more rows\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4\n   from    to Weekday Weight\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     2 Sunday       5\n2     1     2 Monday       2\n3     1     2 Tuesday      3\n# ℹ 1,369 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output above reveals that GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 4541 edges.\nThe command also prints the first six rows of “Node Data” and the first three of “Edge Data”.\nIt states that the Node Data is active. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.\n\n\n\n\nThe nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the activate() function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest “weight” first, we could use activate() and then arrange().\nFor example,\n\nGAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  activate(edges) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Weight))\n\nVisit the reference guide of activate() to find out more about the function."

Both of the arguments for ggraph() are built around igraph. Therefore, ggraph() can use either an igraph object or a tbl_graph object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use theme_graph() to remove the x and y axes.

    "text": "Visualising distribution is not new in statistical analysis. In chapter 1 we have shared with you some of the popular statistical graphics methods for visualising distribution are histogram, probability density curve (pdf), boxplot, notch plot and violin plot and how they can be created by using ggplot2. In this chapter, we are going to share with you two relatively new statistical graphic methods for visualising distribution, namely ridgeline plot and raincloud plot by using ggplot2 and its extensions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, the following R packages will be used, they are:\n\nggridges, a ggplot2 extension specially designed for plotting ridgeline plots,\nggdist, a ggplot2 extension spacially desgin for visualising distribution and uncertainty,\ntidyverse, a family of R packages to meet the modern data science and visual communication needs,\nggthemes, a ggplot extension that provides the user additional themes, scales, and geoms for the ggplots package, and\ncolorspace, an R package provides a broad toolbox for selecting individual colors or color palettes, manipulating these colors, and employing them in various kinds of visualisations.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used load these R packages into RStudio environment.\n\npacman::p_load(ggdist, ggridges, ggthemes,\n               colorspace, tidyverse)\n\n\n\n\nFor the purpose of this exercise, Exam_data.csv will be used.\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv into R and saved it into a tibble data.frame.\n\nexam &lt;- read_csv(\"DataEx04/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Ridgeline Plot of English scores by Class\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe Plot (English)The Code Chunk (English)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Plot (Maths)The Code Chunk (Maths)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nThe PlotThe Code Chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe PlotThe Code Chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2. This produces a narrow boxplot. We reduce the width and adjust the opacity.\n\nThe PlotThe Code Chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the third geometry layer using stat_dots() of ggdist package. This produces a half-dotplot, which is similar to a histogram that indicates the number of samples (number of dots) in each bin. We select side = “left” to indicate we want it on the left-hand side.\n\nThe PlotThe Code Chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 2)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLastly, coord_flip() of ggplot2 package will be used to flip the raincloud chart horizontally to give it the raincloud appearance. At the same time, theme_economist() of ggthemes package is used to give the raincloud chart a professional publishing standard look.\n\nThe PlotThe Code Chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA) +\n  geom_boxplot(width = .20,\n               outlier.shape = NA) +\n  stat_dots(side = \"left\", \n            justification = 1.2, \n            binwidth = .5,\n            dotsize = 1.5) +\n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\nReference\n\nIntroducing Ridgeline Plots (formerly Joyplots)\nClaus O.

    "text": "Ridgeline plot (sometimes called Joyplot) is a data visualisation technique for revealing the distribution of a numeric value for several groups. Distribution can be represented using histograms or density plots, all aligned to the same horizontal scale and presented with a slight overlap.\nFigure below is a ridgelines plot showing the distribution of English score by class.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Ridgeline Plot of English scores by Class\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\n\nRidgeline plots make sense when the number of group to represent is medium to high, and thus a classic window separation would take to much space. Indeed, the fact that groups overlap each other allows to use space more efficiently. If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are several ways to plot ridgeline plot with R. In this section, you will learn how to plot ridgeline plot by using ggridges package.\nggridges package provides two main geom to plot gridgeline plots, they are: geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(). The former takes height values directly to draw the ridgelines, and the latter first estimates data densities and then draws those using ridgelines.\nThe ridgeline plot below is plotted by using geom_density_ridges().\n\nThe Plot (English)The Code Chunk (English)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Plot (Maths)The Code Chunk (Maths)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = MATHS, \n           y = CLASS)) +\n  geom_density_ridges(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01,\n    bandwidth = 3.4,\n    fill = lighten(\"#7097BB\", .3),\n    color = \"white\"\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    name = \"English grades\",\n    expand = c(0, 0)\n    ) +\n  scale_y_discrete(name = NULL, expand = expansion(add = c(0.2, 2.6))) +\n  theme_ridges()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSometimes we would like to have the area under a ridgeline not filled with a single solid color but rather with colors that vary in some form along the x axis. This effect can be achieved by using either geom_ridgeline_gradient() or geom_density_ridges_gradient(). Both geoms work just like geom_ridgeline() and geom_density_ridges(), except that they allow for varying fill colors. However, they do not allow for alpha transparency in the fill. For technical reasons, we can have changing fill colors or transparency but not both.\n\nThe PlotThe Code Chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH, \n           y = CLASS,\n           fill = stat(x))) +\n  geom_density_ridges_gradient(\n    scale = 3,\n    rel_min_height = 0.01) +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c(name = \"Temp.

    "text": "Raincloud Plot is a data visualisation techniques that produces a half-density to a distribution plot. It gets the name because the density plot is in the shape of a “raincloud”. The raincloud (half-density) plot enhances the traditional box-plot by highlighting multiple modalities (an indicator that groups may exist). The boxplot does not show where densities are clustered, but the raincloud plot does!\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a raincloud plot to visualise the distribution of English score by race. It will be created by using functions provided by ggdist and ggplot2 packages.\n\n\nFirst, we will plot a Half-Eye graph by using stat_halfeye() of ggdist package.\nThis produces a Half Eye visualization, which is contains a half-density and a slab-interval.\n\nThe PlotThe Code Chunk\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggplot(exam, \n       aes(x = RACE, \n           y = ENGLISH)) +\n  stat_halfeye(adjust = 0.5,\n               justification = -0.2,\n               .width = 0,\n               point_colour = NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above\n\n\n\nWe remove the slab interval by setting .width = 0 and point_colour = NA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will add the second geometry layer using geom_boxplot() of ggplot2.

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, we will learn how to create interactive data visualisation by using functions provided by ggiraph and plotlyr packages.\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and launch the following R packages:\n\nggiraph for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive.\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\nDT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\npatchwork for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure.\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to accomplish the task.\n\npacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, \n               patchwork, DT, tidyverse,\n               ggplot2) \n\n\n\n\nIn this section, Exam_data.csv provided will be used. Using read_csv() of readr package, import Exam_data.csv into R.\nThe code chunk below read_csv() of readr package is used to import Exam_data.csv data file into R and save it as an tibble data frame called exam_data.\n\nexam_data &lt;- read_csv(\"DataEx03/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nggiraph is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n How does it work?\nIt extends ggplot2 with:\n\ninteractive geom functions: geom_point_interactive(), geom_col_interactive(), etc.\ninteractive scale functions: scale_color_continuous_interactive(), scale_fill_manual_interactive(), etc.\ninteractive facet functions: facet_wrap_interactive(), facet_grid_interactive() with labeller_interactive().\ninteractive guide functions: guide_colorbar_interactive(), guide_legend_interactive().\ninteractive theme elements: element_line_interactive(), element_rect_interactive(), label_interactive().\n\n\n\n\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph. Then, girafe() will be used to generate an svg object to be displayed on an html page.\n\n\n\n\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\nThe first three lines of codes in the code chunk create a new field called tooltip. At the same time, it populates text in ID and CLASS fields into the newly created field.

This layout was wrapped within the girafe() function to render a single interactive widget.\nCustom styling was applied using opts_hover() and opts_hover_inv() inside girafe() to enhance interactivity. When a student is selected, their dot turns dark, while other points fade slightly in the background. Additionally, the colour of the tooltip background was customised to blue and the font colour as black and bold.\nThe final result is an integrated view where interactivity in one plot automatically updates the display across all other plots, allowing for rich comparative analysis across subjects.\n\ntooltip_css &lt;- \"background-color:#27dfff; \n                font-style:bold; \n                color:black;\" \n\n# Create tooltip text combining ID and CLASS\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- paste0(\n  \"ID: \", exam_data$ID, \"\\nClass: \", exam_data$CLASS\n)\n\n# Create 3 interactive ggplots with the same structure\np1 &lt;- ggplot(exam_data, aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(data_id = ID, tooltip = tooltip),\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\"\n  ) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 100)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +\n  ggtitle(\"Maths\")\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(exam_data, aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(data_id = ID, tooltip = tooltip),\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\"\n  ) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 100)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +\n  ggtitle(\"English\")\n\np3 &lt;- ggplot(exam_data, aes(x = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(data_id = ID, tooltip = tooltip),\n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\"\n  ) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 100)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, breaks = NULL) +\n  ggtitle(\"Science\")\n\n\n# Use patchwork's vertical stacking with /\ncombined_plot &lt;- p1 / p2 / p3\n\n# Render interactive stacked plots\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = combined_plot,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 8,  # Increase height for stacked layout\n  options = list(\n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #ff9305; stroke: black; \"),\n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\"),\n    opts_tooltip(css = tooltip_css) \n  )\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlotly’s R graphing library create interactive web graphics from ggplot2 graphs and/or a custom interface to the (MIT-licensed) JavaScript library plotly.js inspired by the grammar of graphics.

It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.

It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\n\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\n\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n How does it work?\nIt extends ggplot2 with:\n\ninteractive geom functions: geom_point_interactive(), geom_col_interactive(), etc.\ninteractive scale functions: scale_color_continuous_interactive(), scale_fill_manual_interactive(), etc.\ninteractive facet functions: facet_wrap_interactive(), facet_grid_interactive() with labeller_interactive().\ninteractive guide functions: guide_colorbar_interactive(), guide_legend_interactive().\ninteractive theme elements: element_line_interactive(), element_rect_interactive(), label_interactive().\n\n\n\n\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\nNotice that two steps are involved. First, an interactive version of ggplot2 geom (i.e. geom_dotplot_interactive()) will be used to create the basic graph.

It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document.

In this section, I am going to shared with you an ggplot2 extension called patchwork which is specially designed for combining separate ggplot2 graphs into a single figure.\nPatchwork package has a very simple syntax where we can create layouts super easily. Here’s the general syntax that combines:\n\nTwo-Column Layout using the Plus Sign +.\nParenthesis () to create a subplot group.\nTwo-Row Layout using the Division Sign /\n\n\n\n3.5.2 Composing Two ggplot2 Graphs.\nNext, we will combine p1 and p2 to create a composite of two histograms using patchwork. Note how the syntax is used to create the plot.\n\np1 + p2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.3 Composing Three ggplot2 Graphs and in specific position relative to each other.\nWe can plot more complex composite by using appropriate operators. For example, the composite figure below is plotted by using:\n\n“/” operator to stack two ggplot2 graphs,\n“|” operator to place the plots beside each other,\n“()” operator the define the sequence of the plotting.\n\n\n(p1 / p2) | p3\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.4 Creating a Composite Figure with Tag.\nIn order to identify subplots in text, patchwork also provides auto-tagging capabilities as shown in the figure below.\n\n((p1 / p2) | p3) + \n  plot_annotation(tag_levels = 'I')\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.5 Creating Figures with Inserts.\nBeside providing functions to place plots next to each other based on the provided layout. With inset_element() of patchwork, we can place one or several plots or graphic elements freely on top or below another plot.\n\np3 + inset_element(p2, \n                   left = 0.02, \n                   bottom = 0.7, \n                   right = 0.5, \n                   top = 1)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5.6 Creating a composite figure by using patchwork and ggtheme\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\n\npatchwork &lt;- (p1 / p2) | p3\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6 Extra Practice using patchwork and ggtheme\nSelf drew a few more plots p4 to p6 and updated p3 to p3a:\n\np4 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n             aes(x = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, \n                 boundary = 100,\n                 color=\"grey25\", \n                 fill=\"grey90\") +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Distribution of Science scores\")\n\n\n# Top 10 for Maths vs Science\ntop10_p5 &lt;- exam_data %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(MATHS + SCIENCE)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\n# Top 3 for Maths vs Science (with)\ntop3_p5 &lt;- top10_p5 %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(MATHS + SCIENCE)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 3)\n\np5 &lt;- ggplot(exam_data, aes(x = MATHS, y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(data = top10_p5, aes(x = MATHS, y = SCIENCE), color = \"blue\", size = 2) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = top3_p5, aes(label = ID), color = \"orange\", fontface = \"bold\", size = 4) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, size = 0.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 100), ylim = c(0, 100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Science scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\n\n# Top 10 for English vs Science\ntop10_p6 &lt;- exam_data %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(ENGLISH + SCIENCE)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\n# Top 3 for English vs Science\ntop3_p6 &lt;- top10_p6 %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(ENGLISH + SCIENCE)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 3)\n\np6 &lt;- ggplot(exam_data, aes(x = ENGLISH, y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(data = top10_p6, aes(x = ENGLISH, y = SCIENCE), color = \"blue\", size = 2) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = top3_p6, aes(label = ID), color = \"orange\", fontface = \"bold\", size = 4) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, size = 0.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 100), ylim = c(0, 100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Science scores versus English scores for Primary 3\")\n\n\n# Top 10 for English vs Maths\ntop10_p3a &lt;- exam_data %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(ENGLISH + MATHS)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 10)\n\n# Top 3 for English vs Maths\ntop3_p3a &lt;- top10_p3a %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(ENGLISH + MATHS)) %&gt;%\n  slice_head(n = 3)\n\np3a &lt;- ggplot(exam_data, aes(x = MATHS, y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  geom_point(data = top10_p3a, aes(x = MATHS, y = ENGLISH), color = \"blue\", size = 2) +\n  geom_text_repel(data = top3_p3a, aes(label = ID), color = \"orange\", fontface = \"bold\", size = 4) +\n  geom_smooth(method = lm, size = 0.5) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 100), ylim = c(0, 100)) +\n  ggtitle(\"English scores versus Maths scores for Primary 3\")\n\nFigure below is created by combining patchwork and theme_economist() of ggthemes package discussed earlier.\nThe Top 10 students from each plot are highlighted in Blue with the Top students labelled in Orange.\n\npatchwork &lt;- p3a / p5 / p6\npatchwork & theme_economist()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion from the extra practice plots:\nIt was found that “Student036” appeared in all 3 graphs in the Top 3 category and therefore we can postulate that he/she is likely the top student for the Primary 3 cohort.\n\nDraw the plot to illustrate the Gender distribution across the Primary 3 Classes.\n\n# Load required libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Count gender per class\ngender_counts &lt;- exam_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(CLASS, GENDER) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Plot the bar chart\np7 &lt;-  ggplot(gender_counts, aes(x = CLASS, y = count, fill = GENDER)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"dodge\") +\n  labs(title = \"Gender Distribution by Class\",\n       x = \"Class\",\n       y = \"Number of Students\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"Male\" = \"#1f77b4\", \"Female\" = \"pink\")) +\n  theme_wsj()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDraw the plot to illustrate the Racial distribution across the Primary 3 Classes.\n\n# Load libraries\nlibrary(dplyr)\n\n# Ensure RACE is in the desired stacking order\nexam_data$RACE &lt;- factor(exam_data$RACE, levels = c(\"Others\", \"Indian\", \"Malay\", \"Chinese\"))\n\n# Summarize counts of each race per class\nrace_counts &lt;- exam_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(CLASS, RACE) %&gt;%\n  summarise(count = n(), .groups = \"drop\")\n\n# Plot stacked bar chart\np8 &lt;-  ggplot(race_counts, aes(x = CLASS, y = count, fill = RACE)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\") +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\n    \"Chinese\" = \"#1f77b4\",  #

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and load the following R packages:\n\nplotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\ngganimate, an ggplot extension for creating animated statistical graphs.\ngifski converts video frames to GIF animations using pngquant’s fancy features for efficient cross-frame palettes and temporal dithering. It produces animated GIFs that use thousands of colors per frame.\ngapminder: An excerpt of the data available at Gapminder.org.

    "text": "When telling a visually-driven data story, animated graphics tends to attract the interest of the audience and make deeper impression than static graphics. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create animated data visualisation by using gganimate and plotly r packages. At the same time, you will also learn how to (i) reshape data by using tidyr package, and (ii) process, wrangle and transform data by using dplyr package.\n\n\nWhen creating animations, the plot does not actually move. Instead, many individual plots are built and then stitched together as movie frames, just like an old-school flip book or cartoon. Each frame is a different plot when conveying motion, which is built using some relevant subset of the aggregate data. The subset drives the flow of the animation when stitched back together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into the steps for creating an animated statistical graph, it’s important to understand some of the key concepts and terminology related to this type of visualization.\n\nFrame: In an animated line graph, each frame represents a different point in time or a different category. When the frame changes, the data points on the graph are updated to reflect the new data.\nAnimation Attributes: The animation attributes are the settings that control how the animation behaves. For example, you can specify the duration of each frame, the easing function used to transition between frames, and whether to start the animation from the current frame or from the beginning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nBefore you start making animated graphs, you should first ask yourself: Does it makes sense to go through the effort? If you are conducting an exploratory data analysis, a animated graphic may not be worth the time investment. However, if you are giving a presentation, a few well-placed animated graphics can help an audience connect with your topic remarkably better than static counterparts."

This data file consists of 199,999 rows of time-series cyber attack records by country.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below to was used to import eventlog.csv file into R environment and called the data frame as attacks.\n\nattacks &lt;- read_csv(\"DataEx06/eventlog.csv\")\n\n\n\n\nAs a good practice, we aim to examine the imported data frame before further analysis is performed.\nFor example, kable() can be used to review the structure of the imported data frame.\n\nkable(head(attacks))\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\nsource_country\ntz\n\n\n\n\n2015-03-12 15:59:16\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:00:48\nFR\nEurope/Paris\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:02:26\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:02:38\nUS\nAmerica/Chicago\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:03:22\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n2015-03-12 16:03:45\nCN\nAsia/Shanghai\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three columns, namely timestamp, source_country and tz.\n\ntimestamp field stores date-time values in POSIXct format.\nsource_country field stores the source of the attack.

Like choropleth maps, you can create classed or unclassed versions of these maps. The classed ones are known as range-graded or graduated symbols, and the unclassed are called proportional symbols, where the area of the symbols are proportional to the values of the attribute being mapped. In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create a proportional symbol map showing the number of wins by Singapore Pools’ outlets using an R package called tmap."

The full reference guide of the package is available here.\nsuperheat package: A Graphical Tool for Exploring Complex Datasets Using Heatmaps. A system for generating extendable and customizable heatmaps for exploring complex datasets, including big data and data with multiple data types. The full reference guide of the package is available here.\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to plot static heatmaps by using heatmap() of R Stats package.\n\n\nIn this sub-section, we will plot a heatmap by using heatmap() of Base Stats. The code chunk is given below.\n\nwh_heatmap &lt;- heatmap(wh_matrix,\n                      Rowv=NA, Colv=NA)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nBy default, heatmap() plots a cluster heatmap. The arguments Rowv=NA and Colv=NA are used to switch off the option of plotting the row and column dendrograms.\n\n\nTo plot a cluster heatmap, we just have to use the default as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nwh_heatmap &lt;- heatmap(wh_matrix)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe order of both rows and columns is different compare to the native wh_matrix. This is because heatmap do a reordering using clusterisation: it calculates the distance between each pair of rows and columns and try to order them by similarity. Moreover, the corresponding dendrogram are provided beside the heatmap.\n\n\nHere, red cells denotes small values, and red small ones. This heatmap is not really informative. Indeed, the Happiness Score variable have relatively higher values, what makes that the other variables with small values all look the same. Thus, we need to normalize this matrix. This is done using the scale argument. It can be applied to rows or to columns following your needs.\nThe code chunk below normalises the matrix column-wise.\n\nwh_heatmap &lt;- heatmap(wh_matrix,\n                      scale=\"column\",\n                      cexRow = 0.6, \n                      cexCol = 0.8,\n                      margins = c(10, 4))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the values are scaled now. Also note that margins argument is used to ensure that the entire x-axis labels are displayed completely and, cexRow and cexCol arguments are used to define the font size used for y-axis and x-axis labels respectively.\n\n\n\n\nheatmaply is an R package for building interactive cluster heatmap that can be shared online as a stand-alone HTML file. It is designed and maintained by Tal Galili.\nBefore we get started, you should review the Introduction to Heatmaply to have an overall understanding of the features and functions of Heatmaply package. You are also required to have the user manualof the package handy with you for reference purposes.\nIn this section, you will gain hands-on experience on using heatmaply to design an interactive cluster heatmap. We will still use the wh_matrix as the input data.\n\n\n\nheatmaply(mtcars)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows the basic syntax needed to create n interactive heatmap by using heatmaply package.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)])\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nDifferent from heatmap(), for heatmaply() the default horizontal dendrogram is placed on the left hand side of the heatmap.\nThe text label of each raw, on the other hand, is placed on the right hand side of the heat map.\nWhen the x-axis marker labels are too long, they will be rotated by 135 degree from the north.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen analysing multivariate data set, it is very common that the variables in the data sets includes values that reflect different types of measurement. In general, these variables’ values have their own range. In order to ensure that all the variables have comparable values, data transformation are commonly used before clustering.\nThree main data transformation methods are supported by heatmaply(), namely: scale, normalise and percentilse.\n\n\n\nWhen all variables are came from or assumed to come from some normal distribution, then scaling (i.e.: subtract the mean and divide by the standard deviation) would bring them all close to the standard normal distribution.\nIn such a case, each value would reflect the distance from the mean in units of standard deviation.\nThe scale argument in heatmaply() supports column and row scaling.\n\nThe code chunk below is used to scale variable values columewise.\n\nheatmaply(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)],\n          scale = \"column\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen variables in the data comes from possibly different (and non-normal) distributions, the normalize function can be used to bring data to the 0 to 1 scale by subtracting the minimum and dividing by the maximum of all observations.\nThis preserves the shape of each variable’s distribution while making them easily comparable on the same “scale”.\n\nDifferent from Scaling, the normalise method is performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is similar to ranking the variables, but instead of keeping the rank values, divide them by the maximal rank.\nThis is done by using the ecdf of the variables on their own values, bringing each value to its empirical percentile.\nThe benefit of the percentize function is that each value has a relatively clear interpretation, it is the percent of observations that got that value or below it.\n\nSimilar to Normalize method, the Percentize method is also performed on the input data set i.e. wh_matrix as shown in the code chunk below.\n\nheatmaply(percentize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nheatmaply supports a variety of hierarchical clustering algorithm. The main arguments provided are:\n\ndistfun: function used to compute the distance (dissimilarity) between both rows and columns. Defaults to dist. The options “pearson”, “spearman” and “kendall” can be used to use correlation-based clustering, which uses as.dist(1 - cor(t(x))) as the distance metric (using the specified correlation method).\nhclustfun: function used to compute the hierarchical clustering when Rowv or Colv are not dendrograms. Defaults to hclust.\ndist_method default is NULL, which results in “euclidean” to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to distfun. By default distfun is “dist”” hence this can be one of “euclidean”, “maximum”, “manhattan”, “canberra”, “binary” or “minkowski”.\nhclust_method default is NULL, which results in “complete” method to be used. It can accept alternative character strings indicating the method to be passed to hclustfun. By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average” (= UPGMA), “mcquitty” (= WPGMA), “median” (= WPGMC) or “centroid” (= UPGMC).\n\nIn general, a clustering model can be calibrated either manually or statistically.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmap is plotted by using hierachical clustering algorithm with “Euclidean distance” and “ward.D” method.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, the dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\n\nwh_d &lt;- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output table shows that “average” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.\n\nwh_clust &lt;- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k &lt;- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure above shows that k=3 would be good.\nWith reference to the statistical analysis results, we can prepare the code chunk as shown below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default options is “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) which optimizes the above criterion (in O(n^4)). Another option is “GW” (Gruvaeus and Wainer) which aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “mean” gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. heatmaply users, however, can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\nIn the code chunk below, the Blues colour palette of rColorBrewer is used.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing a wide collection of arguments for meeting the statistical analysis needs, heatmaply also provides many plotting features to ensure cartographic quality heatmap can be produced.\nIn the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

By default hclustfun is hclust hence this can be one of “ward.D”, “ward.D2”, “single”, “complete”, “average” (= UPGMA), “mcquitty” (= WPGMA), “median” (= WPGMC) or “centroid” (= UPGMC).\n\nIn general, a clustering model can be calibrated either manually or statistically.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, the heatmap is plotted by using hierachical clustering algorithm with “Euclidean distance” and “ward.D” method.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"ward.D\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn order to determine the best clustering method and number of cluster the dend_expend() and find_k() functions of dendextend package will be used.\nFirst, the dend_expend() will be used to determine the recommended clustering method to be used.\n\nwh_d &lt;- dist(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]), method = \"euclidean\")\ndend_expend(wh_d)[[3]]\n\n  dist_methods hclust_methods     optim\n1      unknown         ward.D 0.6137851\n2      unknown        ward.D2 0.6289186\n3      unknown         single 0.4774362\n4      unknown       complete 0.6434009\n5      unknown        average 0.6701688\n6      unknown       mcquitty 0.5020102\n7      unknown         median 0.5901833\n8      unknown       centroid 0.6338734\n\n\nThe output table shows that “average” method should be used because it gave the high optimum value.\nNext, find_k() is used to determine the optimal number of cluster.\n\nwh_clust &lt;- hclust(wh_d, method = \"average\")\nnum_k &lt;- find_k(wh_clust)\nplot(num_k)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure above shows that k=3 would be good.\nWith reference to the statistical analysis results, we can prepare the code chunk as shown below.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          dist_method = \"euclidean\",\n          hclust_method = \"average\",\n          k_row = 3)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the problems with hierarchical clustering is that it doesn’t actually place the rows in a definite order, it merely constrains the space of possible orderings. Take three items A, B and C. If you ignore reflections, there are three possible orderings: ABC, ACB, BAC. If clustering them gives you ((A+B)+C) as a tree, you know that C can’t end up between A and B, but it doesn’t tell you which way to flip the A+B cluster. It doesn’t tell you if the ABC ordering will lead to a clearer-looking heatmap than the BAC ordering.\nheatmaply uses the seriation package to find an optimal ordering of rows and columns. Optimal means to optimize the Hamiltonian path length that is restricted by the dendrogram structure. This, in other words, means to rotate the branches so that the sum of distances between each adjacent leaf (label) will be minimized. This is related to a restricted version of the travelling salesman problem.\nHere we meet our first seriation algorithm: Optimal Leaf Ordering (OLO). This algorithm starts with the output of an agglomerative clustering algorithm and produces a unique ordering, one that flips the various branches of the dendrogram around so as to minimize the sum of dissimilarities between adjacent leaves. Here is the result of applying Optimal Leaf Ordering to the same clustering result as the heatmap above.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"OLO\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default options is “OLO” (Optimal leaf ordering) which optimizes the above criterion (in O(n^4)). Another option is “GW” (Gruvaeus and Wainer) which aims for the same goal but uses a potentially faster heuristic.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"GW\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “mean” gives the output we would get by default from heatmap functions in other packages such as gplots::heatmap.2.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"mean\")\n\n\n\n\n\nThe option “none” gives us the dendrograms without any rotation that is based on the data matrix.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe default colour palette uses by heatmaply is viridis. heatmaply users, however, can use other colour palettes in order to improve the aestheticness and visual friendliness of the heatmap.\nIn the code chunk below, the Blues colour palette of rColorBrewer is used.\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeside providing a wide collection of arguments for meeting the statistical analysis needs, heatmaply also provides many plotting features to ensure cartographic quality heatmap can be produced.\nIn the code chunk below the following arguments are used:\n\nk_row is used to produce 5 groups.\nmargins is used to change the top margin to 60 and row margin to 200.\nfontsizw_row and fontsize_col are used to change the font size for row and column labels to 4.\nmain is used to write the main title of the plot.\nxlab and ylab are used to write the x-axis and y-axis labels respectively.\n\n\nheatmaply(normalize(wh_matrix[, -c(1, 2, 4, 5)]),\n          Colv=NA,\n          seriate = \"none\",\n          colors = Blues,\n          k_row = 5,\n          margins = c(NA,200,60,NA),\n          fontsize_row = 4,\n          fontsize_col = 5,\n          main=\"World Happiness Score and Variables by Country, 2018 \\nDataTransformation using Normalise Method\",\n          xlab = \"World Happiness Indicators\",\n          ylab = \"World Countries\"\n          )"

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, you will gain hands-on experiences on designing treemap using appropriate R packages. The hands-on exercise consists of three main section. First, you will learn how to manipulate transaction data into a treemap strcuture by using selected functions provided in dplyr package. Then, you will learn how to plot static treemap by using treemap package. In the third section, you will learn how to design interactive treemap by using d3treeR package.\n\n\n\nBefore we get started, you are required to check if treemap and tidyverse pacakges have been installed in you R.\n\npacman::p_load(treemap, treemapify, tidyverse) \n\n\n\n\nIn this exercise, REALIS2018.csv data will be used. This dataset provides information of private property transaction records in 2018. The dataset is extracted from REALIS portal (https://spring.ura.gov.sg/lad/ore/login/index.cfm) of Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA).\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, read_csv() of readr is used to import realis2018.csv into R and parsed it into tibble R data.frame format.\n\nrealis2018 &lt;- read_csv(\"DataEx09/realis2018.csv\")\n\nThe output tibble data.frame is called realis2018.\n\n\n\nThe data.frame realis2018 is in trasaction record form, which is highly disaggregated and not appropriate to be used to plot a treemap. In this section, we will perform the following steps to manipulate and prepare a data.frtame that is appropriate for treemap visualisation:\n\ngroup transaction records by Project Name, Planning Region, Planning Area, Property Type and Type of Sale, and\ncompute Total Unit Sold, Total Area, Median Unit Price and Median Transacted Price by applying appropriate summary statistics on No. of Units, Area (sqm), Unit Price ($ psm) and Transacted Price ($) respectively.\n\nTwo key verbs of dplyr package, namely: group_by() and summarize() will be used to perform these steps.\ngroup_by() breaks down a data.frame into specified groups of rows. When you then apply the verbs above on the resulting object they’ll be automatically applied “by group”.\nGrouping affects the verbs as follows:\n\ngrouped select() is the same as ungrouped select(), except that grouping variables are always retained.\ngrouped arrange() is the same as ungrouped; unless you set .by_group = TRUE, in which case it orders first by the grouping variables.\nmutate() and filter() are most useful in conjunction with window functions (like rank(), or min(x) == x). They are described in detail in vignette(“window-functions”).\nsample_n() and sample_frac() sample the specified number/fraction of rows in each group.\nsummarise() computes the summary for each group.\n\nIn our case, group_by() will used together with summarise() to derive the summarised data.frame.\n\n\n\nThe code chank below shows a typical two lines code approach to perform the steps.\n\nrealis2018_grouped &lt;- group_by(realis2018, `Project Name`,\n                               `Planning Region`, `Planning Area`, \n                               `Property Type`, `Type of Sale`)\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- summarise(realis2018_grouped, \n                          `Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE), \n                          `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAggregation functions such as sum() and meadian() obey the usual rule of missing values: if there’s any missing value in the input, the output will be a missing value. The argument na.rm = TRUE removes the missing values prior to computation.\n\n\nThe code chunk above is not very efficient because we have to give each intermediate data.frame a name, even though we don’t have to care about it.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a more efficient way to tackle the same processes by using the pipe, %&gt;%:\n\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- realis2018 %&gt;% \n  group_by(`Project Name`,`Planning Region`, \n           `Planning Area`, `Property Type`, \n           `Type of Sale`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE), \n            `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\ntreemap package is a R package specially designed to offer great flexibility in drawing treemaps. The core function, namely: treemap() offers at least 43 arguments. In this section, we will only explore the major arguments for designing elegent and yet truthful treemaps.\n\n\nIn this section, treemap() of Treemap package is used to plot a treemap showing the distribution of median unit prices and total unit sold of resale condominium by geographic hierarchy in 2017.\nFirst, we will select records belongs to resale condominium property type from realis2018_selected data frame.\n\nrealis2018_selected &lt;- realis2018_summarised %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == \"Condominium\", `Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below designed a treemap by using three core arguments of treemap(), namely: index, vSize and vColor.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the three arguments used:\n\nindex\n\nThe index vector must consist of at least two column names or else no hierarchy treemap will be plotted.\nIf multiple column names are provided, such as the code chunk above, the first name is the highest aggregation level, the second name the second highest aggregation level, and so on.\n\nvSize\n\nThe column must not contain negative values. This is because it’s vaues will be used to map the sizes of the rectangles of the treemaps.\n\n\nWarning:\nThe treemap above was wrongly coloured. For a correctly designed treemap, the colours of the rectagles should be in different intensity showing, in our case, median unit prices.\nFor treemap(), vColor is used in combination with the argument type to determines the colours of the rectangles. Without defining type, like the code chunk above, treemap() assumes type = index, in our case, the hierarchy of planning areas.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, type argument is define as value.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type = \"value\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking to learn from the conde chunk above.\n\nThe rectangles are coloured with different intensity of green, reflecting their respective median unit prices.\nThe legend reveals that the values are binned into ten bins, i.e. 0-5000, 5000-10000, etc. with an equal interval of 5000.\n\n\n\n\nThere are two arguments that determine the mapping to color palettes: mapping and palette. The only difference between “value” and “manual” is the default value for mapping. The “value” treemap considers palette to be a diverging color palette (say ColorBrewer’s “RdYlBu”), and maps it in such a way that 0 corresponds to the middle color (typically white or yellow), -max(abs(values)) to the left-end color, and max(abs(values)), to the right-end color. The “manual” treemap simply maps min(values) to the left-end color, max(values) to the right-end color, and mean(range(values)) to the middle color.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a value type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"value\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nalthough the colour palette used is RdYlBu but there are no red rectangles in the treemap above. This is because all the median unit prices are positive.\nThe reason why we see only 5000 to 45000 in the legend is because the range argument is by default c(min(values, max(values)) with some pretty rounding.\n\n\n\n\nThe “manual” type does not interpret the values as the “value” type does. Instead, the value range is mapped linearly to the colour palette.\nThe code chunk below shows a manual type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nThe colour scheme used is very copnfusing. This is because mapping = (min(values), mean(range(values)), max(values)). It is not wise to use diverging colour palette such as RdYlBu if the values are all positive or negative\n\nTo overcome this problem, a single colour palette such as Blues should be used.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreemap() supports two popular treemap layouts, namely: “squarified” and “pivotSize”. The default is “pivotSize”.\nThe squarified treemap algorithm (Bruls et al., 2000) produces good aspect ratios, but ignores the sorting order of the rectangles (sortID). The ordered treemap, pivot-by-size, algorithm (Bederson et al., 2002) takes the sorting order (sortID) into account while aspect ratios are still acceptable.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots a squarified treemap by changing the algorithm argument.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"squarified\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen “pivotSize” algorithm is used, sortID argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n        sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreemapify is a R package specially developed to draw treemaps in ggplot2. In this section, you will learn how to designing treemps closely resemble treemaps designing in previous section by using treemapify. Before you getting started, you should read Introduction to “treemapify” its user guide.\n\n\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`),\n       layout = \"scol\",\n       start = \"bottomleft\") + \n  geom_treemap() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"light blue\", high = \"blue\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup by Planning Region\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,\n           subgroup = `Planning Region`),\n       start = \"topleft\") + \n  geom_treemap()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGroup by Planning Area\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,\n           subgroup = `Planning Region`,\n           subgroup2 = `Planning Area`)) + \n  geom_treemap()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding boundary line\n\nggplot(data=realis2018_selected, \n       aes(area = `Total Unit Sold`,\n           fill = `Median Unit Price ($ psm)`,\n           subgroup = `Planning Region`,\n           subgroup2 = `Planning Area`)) + \n  geom_treemap() +\n  geom_treemap_subgroup2_border(colour = \"gray40\",\n                                size = 2) +\n  geom_treemap_subgroup_border(colour = \"gray20\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis slide shows you how to install a R package which is not available in cran.\n\nIf this is the first time you install a package from github, you should install devtools package by using the code below or else you can skip this step.\n\n\n#install.packages(\"devtools\")\n\n\nNext, you will load the devtools library and install the package found in github by using the codes below.\n\n\nlibrary(devtools)\n#install_github(\"timelyportfolio/d3treeR\")\n\n\nNow you are ready to launch d3treeR package\n\n\nlibrary(d3treeR)\n\n\n\n\nThe codes below perform two processes.\n\ntreemap() is used to build a treemap by using selected variables in condominium data.frame. The treemap created is save as object called tm.\n\n\ntm &lt;- treemap(realis2018_summarised,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"value\",\n        title=\"Private Residential Property Sold, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThen d3tree() is used to build an interactive treemap.\n\n\nd3tree(tm,rootname = \"Singapore\" )"

They are described in detail in vignette(“window-functions”).\nsample_n() and sample_frac() sample the specified number/fraction of rows in each group.\nsummarise() computes the summary for each group.\n\nIn our case, group_by() will used together with summarise() to derive the summarised data.frame.\n\n\n\nThe code chank below shows a typical two lines code approach to perform the steps.\n\nrealis2018_grouped &lt;- group_by(realis2018, `Project Name`,\n                               `Planning Region`, `Planning Area`, \n                               `Property Type`, `Type of Sale`)\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- summarise(realis2018_grouped, \n                          `Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n                          `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE), \n                          `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nAggregation functions such as sum() and meadian() obey the usual rule of missing values: if there’s any missing value in the input, the output will be a missing value. The argument na.rm = TRUE removes the missing values prior to computation.\n\n\nThe code chunk above is not very efficient because we have to give each intermediate data.frame a name, even though we don’t have to care about it.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a more efficient way to tackle the same processes by using the pipe, %&gt;%:\n\nrealis2018_summarised &lt;- realis2018 %&gt;% \n  group_by(`Project Name`,`Planning Region`, \n           `Planning Area`, `Property Type`, \n           `Type of Sale`) %&gt;%\n  summarise(`Total Unit Sold` = sum(`No. of Units`, na.rm = TRUE), \n            `Total Area` = sum(`Area (sqm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Unit Price ($ psm)` = median(`Unit Price ($ psm)`, na.rm = TRUE),\n            `Median Transacted Price` = median(`Transacted Price ($)`, na.rm = TRUE))"

    "text": "treemap package is a R package specially designed to offer great flexibility in drawing treemaps. The core function, namely: treemap() offers at least 43 arguments. In this section, we will only explore the major arguments for designing elegent and yet truthful treemaps.\n\n\nIn this section, treemap() of Treemap package is used to plot a treemap showing the distribution of median unit prices and total unit sold of resale condominium by geographic hierarchy in 2017.\nFirst, we will select records belongs to resale condominium property type from realis2018_selected data frame.\n\nrealis2018_selected &lt;- realis2018_summarised %&gt;%\n  filter(`Property Type` == \"Condominium\", `Type of Sale` == \"Resale\")\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below designed a treemap by using three core arguments of treemap(), namely: index, vSize and vColor.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the three arguments used:\n\nindex\n\nThe index vector must consist of at least two column names or else no hierarchy treemap will be plotted.\nIf multiple column names are provided, such as the code chunk above, the first name is the highest aggregation level, the second name the second highest aggregation level, and so on.\n\nvSize\n\nThe column must not contain negative values. This is because it’s vaues will be used to map the sizes of the rectangles of the treemaps.\n\n\nWarning:\nThe treemap above was wrongly coloured. For a correctly designed treemap, the colours of the rectagles should be in different intensity showing, in our case, median unit prices.\nFor treemap(), vColor is used in combination with the argument type to determines the colours of the rectangles. Without defining type, like the code chunk above, treemap() assumes type = index, in our case, the hierarchy of planning areas.\n\n\n\nIn the code chunk below, type argument is define as value.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type = \"value\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThinking to learn from the conde chunk above.\n\nThe rectangles are coloured with different intensity of green, reflecting their respective median unit prices.\nThe legend reveals that the values are binned into ten bins, i.e. 0-5000, 5000-10000, etc. with an equal interval of 5000.\n\n\n\n\nThere are two arguments that determine the mapping to color palettes: mapping and palette. The only difference between “value” and “manual” is the default value for mapping. The “value” treemap considers palette to be a diverging color palette (say ColorBrewer’s “RdYlBu”), and maps it in such a way that 0 corresponds to the middle color (typically white or yellow), -max(abs(values)) to the left-end color, and max(abs(values)), to the right-end color. The “manual” treemap simply maps min(values) to the left-end color, max(values) to the right-end color, and mean(range(values)) to the middle color.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below shows a value type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"value\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThing to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nalthough the colour palette used is RdYlBu but there are no red rectangles in the treemap above. This is because all the median unit prices are positive.\nThe reason why we see only 5000 to 45000 in the legend is because the range argument is by default c(min(values, max(values)) with some pretty rounding.\n\n\n\n\nThe “manual” type does not interpret the values as the “value” type does. Instead, the value range is mapped linearly to the colour palette.\nThe code chunk below shows a manual type treemap.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"RdYlBu\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above:\n\nThe colour scheme used is very copnfusing. This is because mapping = (min(values), mean(range(values)), max(values)). It is not wise to use diverging colour palette such as RdYlBu if the values are all positive or negative\n\nTo overcome this problem, a single colour palette such as Blues should be used.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntreemap() supports two popular treemap layouts, namely: “squarified” and “pivotSize”. The default is “pivotSize”.\nThe squarified treemap algorithm (Bruls et al., 2000) produces good aspect ratios, but ignores the sorting order of the rectangles (sortID). The ordered treemap, pivot-by-size, algorithm (Bederson et al., 2002) takes the sorting order (sortID) into account while aspect ratios are still acceptable.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below plots a squarified treemap by changing the algorithm argument.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"squarified\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen “pivotSize” algorithm is used, sortID argument can be used to dertemine the order in which the rectangles are placed from top left to bottom right.\n\ntreemap(realis2018_selected,\n        index=c(\"Planning Region\", \"Planning Area\", \"Project Name\"),\n        vSize=\"Total Unit Sold\",\n        vColor=\"Median Unit Price ($ psm)\",\n        type=\"manual\",\n        palette=\"Blues\", \n        algorithm = \"pivotSize\",\n        sortID = \"Median Transacted Price\",\n        title=\"Resale Condominium by Planning Region and Area, 2017\",\n        title.legend = \"Median Unit Price (S$ per sq. m)\"\n        )"

This is apprpriate for numerical variable like age or age bands. Readers can easily assess relative sizes, which support the effective visual comparison (i.e. comparing which age has a higher count).\nThe second plot on “Population by Age Group” has banded the ages into 4 Age Groups, namely: Adult, Child, Senior and Youth. This helps to condense the chart into age categories for quick selection if one intends to zoom in to a particularly age group for analysis.\nAssessment: I would give this a rather high score on the clarity scale.\n\nClear Labelling and Minimal Chart Junk\n\nThe Axis Labels were simple and understanbleable. For both plots, the Y-axis population intervals with the use of horizontal grid lines allow for clear relative reference and comparisons. Furthermore the grid line are in lighter tone of grey which does not distract the viewer.\nWith no excessive gridlines, background noise, or distracting embellishments, Chih Yuan was able to apply the principle of minimizing “non-data ink” to maintain visual clarity.\nAssessment: I would give this a good score on the clarity scale.\n\nFunctional Simplicity\n\nThe plot avoids excessive color schemes, 3D effects, or elaborate design, ensuring that the focus remains solely on the dataset itself. The use of colours also made the visual easier to identify age groupings which confusion, especially avoiding “colour blind” schemes.\nIt can be observed that Chih Yuan has likely prioritized clarity over unnecessary decoration is a strong point.\n\n\n 3 Areas for Improvement \n\nMore Data-meaningful Colour Encoding for Plot A\n\nOriginally only one colour was used in Plot A, whch is “steelblue”. And all ages were treated uniformly with no extra information encoded visually. However, in Plot B, the ages were broken down in to Age Groups and had respectively colours.\nImprovements: With each Age bar coloured by the Age Group (i.e. Chlid, Youth, Adult, Senior etc.) according to a meaningful colour palette, the read would be able to immediately perceive a generation structure (by colour) on Plot A. This is to adhere to the design principle where it leverages on the pre-attentive attributes to encode extra informationn for instant recognition.\nHow this is done: use a customized scale_fill_manual() based on Age Bands.\n\nBetter X-Axis Scale (Breaks) and Age Handling\n\nThe original plot was created with bar for AgeNum but the Age axis was cluttered with every single year shown with the defauly ggplot spacing. This might cause readers to have a cognitive overload trying to trace the exact age levels.\nImprovements: There is a need to have explicit control over the X-axis breaks using breaks = seq(0, 110, by = 5), where the age labels are every 5 years intervals. this makes the chart easier to read and keeps the chart clean and orderly. The design principle was to reduce clutter and optimise scales for faster comprehension.\n\nClearer Population by Age Group Plot (with Dual Labels)\n\nThe original plot p2 uses AgeGroup categories correctly but plots only height (population count) as an absolute value. This does not give the reader a sense of relative comparison between Age Groups.\nImprovements: In the Plot B, bar labels where included to show the population count inside the bar and the percentage value outside the bar. This gives the reader both the absolute and relative metrics for the visuals. The design principle is to make data-ink ratio higher and avoid having readers to calculate information manually."

What are the identifiable daily temporal patterns in communications?\n\n\n\n\nThe daily communication volume fluctuates slightly between 34 and 49 messages, with an average of approximately 42 messages per day, highlighting a stable overall activity level. Notably, the highest volume occurs on 11th October (49 messages), immediately following the lowest volume the day before on 10th October (34 messages)—a sharp rebound that may signal a response to specific events or operational needs. Despite these fluctuations, the system maintains a consistent tempo across the two weeks.\nThe temporal analysis using both the heat map and time series plots reveals a pronounced morning-centric communication rhythm. The vast majority of radio traffic is concentrated between 9:00 AM and 11:30 AM, with the most intense peaks typically occurring between 10:00 and 11:00 AM. With reference to the Density plot of Daily half-hourly message volume, of the 14 days, we see message density peaks at 10:30 AM on 9 days, while on 3 days, it peaks at 12:30 PM.\nFor instance if we were to based in on the hourly plot, 5th October (Fri) and 11th October (Thu) both register their highest single-hour counts at 10:00 AM at 24 and 21 messages respectively. Communication activity drops off steeply after lunchtime, with more than 90% of the days showing little to no activity after 2:30 PM. This pattern suggests a highly structured daily workflow, where key decisions and coordination are front-loaded in the day. Importantly, the hourly heat map also indicates that this routine holds across both weekdays and weekends—communication volumes and peak hours remain similar, underlining the operational regularity of the group regardless of the day of week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1b. How do these patterns shift over the two weeks of observations?\n\n\n\n\nOver the two-week period, while the timing and structure of communication peaks remain broadly consistent, there are subtle shifts in both intensity and timing. Some days, such as 3rd, 5th, 11th and 12th October, see particularly high spikes in the mid-morning, which may correspond to critical events, decision points, or heightened urgency. The sharp dip on October 8th and 13th, immediately after a period of “surge” (3rd - 7th and 9th to 12th October), points to possible responses to interruptions, lulls, or triggering incidents. Overall, although the daily messaging routine is remarkably stable, these bursts and brief lulls provide clues to changing circumstances or stress points in the operation—an analytical signal that warrants closer inspection of event logs or external triggers for those dates.\nAnother notable change in the communication pattern is observed during the weekends. In the first week, weekend communication peaks occurred earlier, typically between 10:00 AM and 11:30 AM, closely mirroring the weekday rhythm. However, in the second week, the weekend peaks shifted noticeably later, with the highest message volumes concentrated around 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM. This shift not only marks a departure from the otherwise stable early-morning communication structure but also suggests an adaptive or reactive operational schedule—potentially in response to evolving events, increased coordination needs, or changing priorities as the observation period progressed. The contrast between the two weekends is clear in the heatmap, underscoring the importance of monitoring such shifts as possible indicators of underlying changes in group behavior or external pressures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVAST Challenge Task & Question 1c\n\n\n\nClepper found that messages frequently came in at around the same time each day.\n\nFocus on a specific entity and use this information to determine who has influence over them.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe first extracted the relevant communication edges from the dataset, pairing “sent” and “received” communication events to form entity-to-entity links. We retained only those edges where both nodes represent real-world entities (Person, Organization, Vessel, Group, or Location), ensuring that our analysis focuses on the meaningful actors in the Oceanus network.\n\n\nCode\n# Extract sent and received communication event edges\nsent_edges &lt;- mc3_edges_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(type == \"sent\") %&gt;%\n  select(source_entity = from_id, event = to_id)\n\nreceived_edges &lt;- mc3_edges_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(type == \"received\") %&gt;%\n  select(event = from_id, target_entity = to_id)\n\n# Pair sent and received to form communication edges\npaired_edges &lt;- sent_edges %&gt;%\n  inner_join(received_edges, by = \"event\") %&gt;%\n  select(from = source_entity, to = target_entity)\n\n# Add unmatched sent and received edges (optional, for completeness)\nsingle_sent_edges &lt;- sent_edges %&gt;%\n  select(from = source_entity, to = event)\nsingle_received_edges &lt;- received_edges %&gt;%\n  select(from = event, to = target_entity)\n\nall_edges &lt;- bind_rows(paired_edges, single_sent_edges, single_received_edges) %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n\n# Identify entity nodes (Person, Organization, Vessel, Group, Location)\nentity_ids &lt;- mc3_nodes_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(sub_type %in% c(\"Person\", \"Organization\", \"Vessel\", \"Group\", \"Location\")) %&gt;%\n  pull(id) %&gt;% as.character()\n\nentity_edges &lt;- all_edges %&gt;%\n  filter(as.character(from) %in% entity_ids, as.character(to) %in% entity_ids)\n\nentity_nodes &lt;- mc3_nodes_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(sub_type %in% c(\"Person\", \"Organization\", \"Vessel\", \"Group\", \"Location\")) %&gt;%\n  select(id, label, sub_type)\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing these cleaned and filtered edges and nodes, we built a global directed graph representing the Oceanus community. We then computed key network centrality metrics for each node—PageRank, betweenness, and degree—quantifying the influence and connectivity of every entity in the overall network.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(igraph)\n\ng &lt;- graph_from_data_frame(d = entity_edges, vertices = entity_nodes, directed = TRUE)\n\n# Compute centralities\nV(g)$pagerank &lt;- page_rank(g)$vector\nV(g)$betweenness &lt;- betweenness(g)\nV(g)$degree &lt;- degree(g)\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing on “Nadia Conti”, we identified her node and extracted her two-step ego network, capturing both direct and indirect connections within the broader network.

Miesel Shipping, and Elise. Nadia herself consistently ranks among the top nodes by these measures, highlighting her role as both an influencer and an information bridge. Entities such as Neptune and V. Miesel Shipping, which also score highly in centrality, exert considerable influence over Nadia’s information flow and access to other parts of the network.\nDegree centrality analysis shows Nadia maintains multiple direct connections, particularly with other highly active nodes, ensuring she is closely linked to key hubs in the network. Betweenness centrality further reveals that Nadia is not only well-connected but also acts as an important intermediary, facilitating communication between otherwise distant parts of the network. PageRank confirms that her immediate environment is composed of actors with significant structural power, increasing the likelihood that Nadia is both influenced by, and exerts influence upon, the most pivotal players in Oceanus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(igraph)\nlibrary(visNetwork)\n\n# -- Build the global network g as in your earlier code (using your entity_nodes/entity_edges) --\n\ng &lt;- graph_from_data_frame(\n  d = entity_edges, \n  vertices = entity_nodes, \n  directed = TRUE\n)\n\n# -- Get Nadia's index in g --\nnadia_label &lt;- \"Nadia Conti\"\ntarget_index &lt;- which(V(g)$label == nadia_label)\n\n# -- Extract Nadia's 1-hop ego network (all direct neighbors) --\nego_1 &lt;- make_ego_graph(g, order = 1, nodes = target_index, mode = \"all\")[[1]]\n\n\n# 1.

With a focus on “Nadia Conti”, the visuals above could determine who has influence over this person.\n\n\n\n\nDegree centrality reveals that Nadia Conti is well-connected within her local network, with a degree of 17. However, she is not the most connected node; vessels such as Mako (37), Reef Guardian (27), and Remora (21), as well as organizations like Oceanus City Council (28) and V. Miesel Shipping (19), have even higher degrees. This indicates that while Nadia is an important hub, her sphere of direct interaction is embedded within a dense mesh of other highly connected entities.\nSeveral other individuals (e.g., Davis with 16, Boss with 13, Mrs. Money with 12) and vessels (e.g., Neptune with 19, Sentinel with 16) also play significant roles in Nadia’s network. The presence of organizations (e.g., Green Guardians, Sailor Shifts Team), multiple vessels, and key persons shows that Nadia’s environment is both diverse and robust.\nDirect Connections\nThese direct connections are clearly shown as nodes that have edges (arrows) going into or out of Nadia Conti’s node in the network diagrams. Nadia Conti directly connects to several core entities across different types:\n\nPeople: Elise, Liam Thorne, Davis, Rodriguez\nOrganization: V. Miesel Shipping, Oceanus City Council, Sailor Shifts Team\nVessel: Neptune, Marlin, Remora, Sentinel\nLocation: Haacklee Harbor\n\nInterpretation: The PageRank, Betweenness, and Degree centrality plots all consistently show Nadia Conti as a major hub, with a large node size reflecting her high centrality. Her immediate network includes influential vessels (Neptune, Remora), organizations (V. Miesel Shipping, Oceanus City Council), and several persons (Elise, Davis, Rodriguez).\nNadia’s position suggests she is a key connector and influencer but is herself surrounded by even larger hubs, particularly among vessels and organizations. Her ability to influence—and be influenced—is amplified by these connections, as these high-degree entities are likely sources and conduits of critical information and operational coordination. This structure points to a tightly interwoven community, where central actors such as Mako, Oceanus City Council, and V. Miesel Shipping may exert the most substantial influence over Nadia’s access to information, resources, and strategic decisions."

Full description of node attributes and edge attributes is shown below.\nNodes Attributes are as such:\n\n\n\nNode Subtypes\n\n\nEdge Attributes are as such:\n\n\n\nNode-Edge-Node Matrix\n\n\n\n\n\nBefore preparing the data, it is always a good practice to examine the structure of mc3 knowledge graph.\nIn the code chunk below glimpse() is used to reveal the structure of mc3 knowledge graph.\n\nglimpse(MC3)\n\nList of 5\n $ directed  : logi TRUE\n $ multigraph: logi FALSE\n $ graph     :List of 4\n  ..$ mode        : chr \"static\"\n  ..$ edge_default: Named list()\n  ..$ node_default: Named list()\n  ..$ name        : chr \"VAST_MC3_Knowledge_Graph\"\n $ nodes     :'data.frame': 1159 obs. of  31 variables:\n  ..$ type             : chr [1:1159] \"Entity\" \"Entity\" \"Entity\" \"Entity\" ...\n  ..$ label            : chr [1:1159] \"Sam\" \"Kelly\" \"Nadia Conti\" \"Elise\" ...\n  ..$ name             : chr [1:1159] \"Sam\" \"Kelly\" \"Nadia Conti\" \"Elise\" ...\n  ..$ sub_type         : chr [1:1159] \"Person\" \"Person\" \"Person\" \"Person\" ...\n  ..$ id               : chr [1:1159] \"Sam\" \"Kelly\" \"Nadia Conti\" \"Elise\" ...\n  ..$ timestamp        : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ monitoring_type  : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ findings         : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ content          : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ assessment_type  : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ results          : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ movement_type    : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ destination      : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ enforcement_type : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ outcome          : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ activity_type    : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ participants     : int [1:1159] NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ thing_collected  :'data.frame':   1159 obs. of  2 variables:\n  .. ..$ type: chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  .. ..$ name: chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ reference        : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ date             : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ time             : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ friendship_type  : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ permission_type  : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ start_date       : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ end_date         : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ report_type      : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ submission_date  : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ jurisdiction_type: chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ authority_level  : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ coordination_type: chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n  ..$ operational_role : chr [1:1159] NA NA NA NA ...\n $ edges     :'data.frame': 3226 obs. of  5 variables:\n  ..$ id         : chr [1:3226] \"2\" \"3\" \"5\" \"3013\" ...\n  ..$ is_inferred: logi [1:3226] TRUE FALSE TRUE TRUE TRUE TRUE ...\n  ..$ source     : chr [1:3226] \"Sam\" \"Sam\" \"Sam\" \"Sam\" ...\n  ..$ target     : chr [1:3226] \"Relationship_Suspicious_217\" \"Event_Communication_370\" \"Event_Assessment_600\" \"Relationship_Colleagues_430\" ...\n  ..$ type       : chr [1:3226] NA \"sent\" NA NA ...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nNotice that Industry field is in list data type.

What are the identifiable daily temporal patterns in communications?\n\n\n\n\nThe daily communication volume fluctuates slightly between 34 and 49 messages, with an average of approximately 42 messages per day, highlighting a stable overall activity level. Notably, the highest volume occurs on 11th October (49 messages), immediately following the lowest volume the day before on 10th October (34 messages)—a sharp rebound that may signal a response to specific events or operational needs. Despite these fluctuations, the system maintains a consistent tempo across the two weeks.\nThe temporal analysis using both the heat map and time series plots reveals a pronounced morning-centric communication rhythm. The vast majority of radio traffic is concentrated between 9:00 AM and 11:30 AM, with the most intense peaks typically occurring between 10:00 and 11:00 AM. With reference to the Density plot of Daily half-hourly message volume, of the 14 days, we see message density peaks at 10:30 AM on 9 days, while on 3 days, it peaks at 12:30 PM.\nFor instance if we were to based in on the hourly plot, 5th October (Fri) and 11th October (Thu) both register their highest single-hour counts at 10:00 AM at 24 and 21 messages respectively. Communication activity drops off steeply after lunchtime, with more than 90% of the days showing little to no activity after 2:30 PM. This pattern suggests a highly structured daily workflow, where key decisions and coordination are front-loaded in the day. Importantly, the hourly heat map also indicates that this routine holds across both weekdays and weekends—communication volumes and peak hours remain similar, underlining the operational regularity of the group regardless of the day of week.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1b. How do these patterns shift over the two weeks of observations?\n\n\n\n\nOver the two-week period, while the timing and structure of communication peaks remain broadly consistent, there are subtle shifts in both intensity and timing. Some days, such as 3rd, 5th, 11th and 12th October, see particularly high spikes in the mid-morning, which may correspond to critical events, decision points, or heightened urgency. The sharp dip on October 8th and 13th, immediately after a period of “surge” (3rd - 7th and 9th to 12th October), points to possible responses to interruptions, lulls, or triggering incidents. Overall, although the daily messaging routine is remarkably stable, these bursts and brief lulls provide clues to changing circumstances or stress points in the operation—an analytical signal that warrants closer inspection of event logs or external triggers for those dates.\nAnother notable change in the communication pattern is observed during the weekends. In the first week, weekend communication peaks occurred earlier, typically between 10:00 AM and 11:30 AM, closely mirroring the weekday rhythm. However, in the second week, the weekend peaks shifted noticeably later, with the highest message volumes concentrated around 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM. This shift not only marks a departure from the otherwise stable early-morning communication structure but also suggests an adaptive or reactive operational schedule—potentially in response to evolving events, increased coordination needs, or changing priorities as the observation period progressed. The contrast between the two weekends is clear in the heatmap, underscoring the importance of monitoring such shifts as possible indicators of underlying changes in group behavior or external pressures."

We retained only those edges where both nodes represent real-world entities (Person, Organization, Vessel, Group, or Location), ensuring that our analysis focuses on the meaningful actors in the Oceanus network.\n\n\nCode\n# Extract sent and received communication event edges\nsent_edges &lt;- mc3_edges_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(type == \"sent\") %&gt;%\n  select(source_entity = from_id, event = to_id)\n\nreceived_edges &lt;- mc3_edges_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(type == \"received\") %&gt;%\n  select(event = from_id, target_entity = to_id)\n\n# Pair sent and received to form communication edges\npaired_edges &lt;- sent_edges %&gt;%\n  inner_join(received_edges, by = \"event\") %&gt;%\n  select(from = source_entity, to = target_entity)\n\n# Add unmatched sent and received edges (optional, for completeness)\nsingle_sent_edges &lt;- sent_edges %&gt;%\n  select(from = source_entity, to = event)\nsingle_received_edges &lt;- received_edges %&gt;%\n  select(from = event, to = target_entity)\n\nall_edges &lt;- bind_rows(paired_edges, single_sent_edges, single_received_edges) %&gt;%\n  distinct()\n\n# Identify entity nodes (Person, Organization, Vessel, Group, Location)\nentity_ids &lt;- mc3_nodes_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(sub_type %in% c(\"Person\", \"Organization\", \"Vessel\", \"Group\", \"Location\")) %&gt;%\n  pull(id) %&gt;% as.character()\n\nentity_edges &lt;- all_edges %&gt;%\n  filter(as.character(from) %in% entity_ids, as.character(to) %in% entity_ids)\n\nentity_nodes &lt;- mc3_nodes_cleaned %&gt;%\n  filter(sub_type %in% c(\"Person\", \"Organization\", \"Vessel\", \"Group\", \"Location\")) %&gt;%\n  select(id, label, sub_type)\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing these cleaned and filtered edges and nodes, we built a global directed graph representing the Oceanus community. We then computed key network centrality metrics for each node—PageRank, betweenness, and degree—quantifying the influence and connectivity of every entity in the overall network.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(igraph)\n\ng &lt;- graph_from_data_frame(d = entity_edges, vertices = entity_nodes, directed = TRUE)\n\n# Compute centralities\nV(g)$pagerank &lt;- page_rank(g)$vector\nV(g)$betweenness &lt;- betweenness(g)\nV(g)$degree &lt;- degree(g)\n\n\n\n\n\nFocusing on “Nadia Conti”, we identified her node and extracted her two-step ego network, capturing both direct and indirect connections within the broader network. This local subgraph reveals Nadia’s immediate sphere of influence and the key players connected to her.\n\n\nCode\nnadia_label &lt;- \"Nadia Conti\"\ntarget_index &lt;- which(V(g)$label == nadia_label)\n\nego_graph &lt;- make_ego_graph(g, order = 2, nodes = target_index, mode = \"all\")[[1]]\n\n\n\n\n\nWe visualized Nadia’s ego network using node size, shape, and color to represent centrality and entity type. We also summarized centrality metrics in clear tables, ranking all ego network members by PageRank, Betweenness, and Degree. This allows for direct identification of the most influential, best-connected, and most strategic actors in Nadia Conti’s communication environment.\n\n\nCode\nnodes_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  id = V(ego_graph)$name,\n  label = V(ego_graph)$label,\n  group = V(ego_graph)$sub_type,\n  title = paste0(\"&lt;b&gt;\", V(ego_graph)$label, \"&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\",\n                 \"Degree: \", round(V(ego_graph)$degree, 2), \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                 \"Betweenness: \", round(V(ego_graph)$betweenness, 2), \"&lt;br&gt;\",\n                 \"PageRank: \", round(V(ego_graph)$pagerank, 4)),\n  shape = ifelse(V(ego_graph)$sub_type == \"Person\", \"dot\",\n                 ifelse(V(ego_graph)$sub_type == \"Organization\", \"square\",\n                        ifelse(V(ego_graph)$sub_type == \"Vessel\", \"triangle\",\n                               ifelse(V(ego_graph)$sub_type == \"Group\", \"star\", \"diamond\")))),\n  value = V(ego_graph)$pagerank * 30 + 5\n)\n\nedges_df &lt;- as_data_frame(ego_graph, what = \"edges\") %&gt;%\n  rename(from = from, to = to)\n\nlibrary(visNetwork)\nvisNetwork(nodes_df, edges_df, width = \"100%\", height = \"700px\") %&gt;%\n  visNodes(scaling = list(min = 5, max = 30)) %&gt;%\n  visEdges(\n    arrows = list(to = list(enabled = TRUE, scaleFactor = 0.3)),\n    color = list(color = \"gray\")\n  ) %&gt;%\n  visOptions(\n    highlightNearest = TRUE,\n    nodesIdSelection = TRUE,\n    manipulation = FALSE\n  ) %&gt;%\n  visInteraction(\n    dragNodes = FALSE,\n    dragView = FALSE,\n    zoomView = FALSE\n  ) %&gt;%\n  visLegend() %&gt;%\n  visLayout(randomSeed = 1818)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlobal and Ego-Network Structure\n\n\n\nThe overview network visualization reveals that Nadia Conti is centrally embedded in the Oceanus communication web, maintaining direct and indirect connections with major actors such as Neptune (Vessel), V. Miesel Shipping (Organization), Elise (Person), and others. The use of color and shape coding in the network allows for quick identification of the different types of entities in Nadia’s influence neighborhood.\n\n\n\n\n\nOn both the global and Nadia-focused ego networks, we computed standard network centrality metrics for all nodes:\n\nPageRank (overall influence),\nBetweenness (information brokerage/intermediary role), and\nDegree (number of direct connections).\n\nThese measures quantify the importance and structural roles of each entity relative to Nadia and the broader community.\n\n\nCode\n# PageRank table\npagerank_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  label = V(ego_graph)$label,\n  sub_type = V(ego_graph)$sub_type,\n  pagerank = round(V(ego_graph)$pagerank, 4)\n) %&gt;% arrange(desc(pagerank))\n\n# Betweenness table\nbetweenness_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  label = V(ego_graph)$label,\n  sub_type = V(ego_graph)$sub_type,\n  betweenness = round(V(ego_graph)$betweenness, 2)\n) %&gt;% arrange(desc(betweenness))\n\n# Degree table\ndegree_df &lt;- data.frame(\n  label = V(ego_graph)$label,\n  sub_type = V(ego_graph)$sub_type,\n  degree = V(ego_graph)$degree\n) %&gt;% arrange(desc(degree))\n\n\n\nknitr::kable(pagerank_df, caption = \"PageRank Centrality (Nadia's Ego Network)\")\n\n\nPageRank Centrality (Nadia’s Ego Network)\n\n\nlabel\nsub_type\npagerank\n\n\n\n\nMako\nVessel\n0.0687\n\n\nOceanus City Council\nOrganization\n0.0530\n\n\nReef Guardian\nVessel\n0.0454\n\n\nNadia Conti\nPerson\n0.0432\n\n\nRemora\nVessel\n0.0409\n\n\nV.

Miesel Shipping, and Elise. Nadia herself consistently ranks among the top nodes by these measures, highlighting her role as both an influencer and an information bridge. Entities such as Neptune and V. Miesel Shipping, which also score highly in centrality, exert considerable influence over Nadia’s information flow and access to other parts of the network.\nDegree centrality analysis shows Nadia maintains multiple direct connections, particularly with other highly active nodes, ensuring she is closely linked to key hubs in the network. Betweenness centrality further reveals that Nadia is not only well-connected but also acts as an important intermediary, facilitating communication between otherwise distant parts of the network. PageRank confirms that her immediate environment is composed of actors with significant structural power, increasing the likelihood that Nadia is both influenced by, and exerts influence upon, the most pivotal players in Oceanus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(igraph)\nlibrary(visNetwork)\n\n# -- Build the global network g as in your earlier code (using your entity_nodes/entity_edges) --\n\ng &lt;- graph_from_data_frame(\n  d = entity_edges, \n  vertices = entity_nodes, \n  directed = TRUE\n)\n\n# -- Get Nadia's index in g --\nnadia_label &lt;- \"Nadia Conti\"\ntarget_index &lt;- which(V(g)$label == nadia_label)\n\n# -- Extract Nadia's 1-hop ego network (all direct neighbors) --\nego_1 &lt;- make_ego_graph(g, order = 1, nodes = target_index, mode = \"all\")[[1]]\n\n\n# 1.

With a focus on “Nadia Conti”, the visuals above could determine who has influence over this person.\n\n\n\n\nDegree centrality reveals that Nadia Conti is well-connected within her local network, with a degree of 17. However, she is not the most connected node; vessels such as Mako (37), Reef Guardian (27), and Remora (21), as well as organizations like Oceanus City Council (28) and V. Miesel Shipping (19), have even higher degrees. This indicates that while Nadia is an important hub, her sphere of direct interaction is embedded within a dense mesh of other highly connected entities.\nSeveral other individuals (e.g., Davis with 16, Boss with 13, Mrs. Money with 12) and vessels (e.g., Neptune with 19, Sentinel with 16) also play significant roles in Nadia’s network. The presence of organizations (e.g., Green Guardians, Sailor Shifts Team), multiple vessels, and key persons shows that Nadia’s environment is both diverse and robust.\nDirect Connections\nThese direct connections are clearly shown as nodes that have edges (arrows) going into or out of Nadia Conti’s node in the network diagrams. Nadia Conti directly connects to several core entities across different types:\n\nPeople: Elise, Liam Thorne, Davis, Rodriguez\nOrganization: V. Miesel Shipping, Oceanus City Council, Sailor Shifts Team\nVessel: Neptune, Marlin, Remora, Sentinel\nLocation: Haacklee Harbor\n\nInterpretation: The PageRank, Betweenness, and Degree centrality plots all consistently show Nadia Conti as a major hub, with a large node size reflecting her high centrality. Her immediate network includes influential vessels (Neptune, Remora), organizations (V. Miesel Shipping, Oceanus City Council), and several persons (Elise, Davis, Rodriguez).\nNadia’s position suggests she is a key connector and influencer but is herself surrounded by even larger hubs, particularly among vessels and organizations. Her ability to influence—and be influenced—is amplified by these connections, as these high-degree entities are likely sources and conduits of critical information and operational coordination. This structure points to a tightly interwoven community, where central actors such as Mako, Oceanus City Council, and V. Miesel Shipping may exert the most substantial influence over Nadia’s access to information, resources, and strategic decisions."
